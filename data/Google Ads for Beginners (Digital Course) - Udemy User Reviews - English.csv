Felt this was not an up to date 2020 course - useful but a lot of the Google Ads interface/functionality was significantly different to the version the course ran through.

"you know ive got to say this i purchased Perry Marshals book a year or so ago and got bogged down with it all.  Your course was worth more than his book particularly the walk through examples and just being able to think, oh this will work with that, and if i do that x should be the result. When i started in business back in 2001 i was lucky enough to get adwords working in my favour before everyone else jumped on the band waggon.  Now its a different game completely but i can see by your course all my original mistakes and even current ones. What is funny though, is that i didnt realise about remarketing and now understand why those annoying images would re-appear about a company or business i looked at earlier in the week, now at least i know what they are doing and why.",,Positive,Engaging Content
