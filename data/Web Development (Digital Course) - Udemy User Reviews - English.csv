"I really liked the build first approach in this course, you basically build a mini project for every section you learn. Some sections are little outdated but Angela is adding constant updates.",-,-
"I am absolutely thrilled with this course! The course covers a wide range of web development topics, providing a comprehensive and up-to-date curriculum and Dr Angelas Yus teaching style really encourages you to push forward. Will definitely come back and review.",-,-
"This course definetily was the launchpad I needed to get into the development space. I learnt a lot which I'd like to believe not only  gave me the skills to create but also work my thinking muscles and prowess as a developer. Some part were difficult to maneuver, to be specific the last modules which were based on Blockchain and DApps, configuration of the projects locally was difficult and I had to do a lot of heavy lifting but that's about it when it comes to the downside. Overall, it is enough to equip you with a starter package.",-,-
"I love the course and how everything is explained by Angela but I've come to realize that the only thing that is updated is the year in the course title. A lot of what is taught isn't up to date, this course doesn't cover quite a few things. If you are looking for a more updated course I'd suggest the Odin project (free) or if you prefer video based content Algoexpert (paid).",-,-
"I enjoyed the comprehensive nature of this course, which covered a wide array of topics encompassing both front-end and back-end development. It covered many state-of-the-art topics, including the Node.js, React, REASTful APIs, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, web3, and more.",-,-
"I have went through this course thoroughly with having a full time job. I will say do not judge by public opinion that this course is outdated or anything, the theme always remain the same, if you are a beginner just try getting the core concept what she is sharing,and try to go with each content without comparing it with others, great things takes time and you cannot become a developer in a Month also no course is perfect, its your effort which will make you a developer.",-,-
"The course is good for people like me who don't have any previous experience with developing. It tackles a lot of basic concepts and serves as a principle for further development (even the more deprecated modules have something to teach you, if you are starting from zero). The entire Web3 section is unnecessary in my opinion, as it covers a whole different area not related to front-end or back-end, and could very well by a course on its own to those who are interested in this topic.",-,-
"Angela sounds like she is giving you great instruction but it was a big let down seeing a lot of this course not updated. The most very basic thing, which is var, should be changed to let or const variables. Also, she is quite spotty in her teaching. She glosses over things and misses the main point often especially in the last half of this course. It's almost as if she doesn't have a good grasp of the knowledge and how all these puzzle pieces fit. I was not motivated at all by the time I reached the half of the course because I couldn't understand her use of certain terms. My partner who is an automation engineer, who automates programming itself, has even told me the same. For example, when she is describing ECMA script versus the older technology when writing code require vs import for native modules from node. I gave two stars because although she does explain certain things wonderfully, she is a big let down when she is not updating, or explaining things that are really important at the moment and just glossing over them. This made me leave the course and have to start all over again. She tries to motivate you with these pep talk videos like how you should structure your learning, and how you should take notes, and how you should take breaks and not get overwhelmed like little youtube personal blogs with her on camera. However, in hindsight, this just feels like filler and she wastes crucial time to help you understand some concepts. Good luck and happy coding.",-,-
Every concept is explained very nicely and the teaching approach is what makes this course super amazing as it gives problem statement to solve every single concept. So far loving the tutorial.,-,-
This course is the best web development/programming course I've ever taken. Dr. Angela Yu is clear and concise in her explanations and there are tons of practice exercises. I would definitely recommend!,-,-
"It's great course. I have learnt a lot. Though some parts are a bit outdated that I had to search the web to make it work, but still a great course. Working your ass off by searching things is a part of learning. I definitely recommend this to anyone who wanted to learn about web dev.",-,-
"Thanks a lot Angela! I was a high school graduate without college degree with passion to learn coding, and this course helped me learn web development in 6 months. And after finishing this course, in less than 3 months I got my first job as a Full Stack web developer in a software house. Highly appreciate Angela for creating this amazing course, I highly recommend people who want to start their career as web developer to take this course. Thanks Angela for creating this amazing course.",-,-
"I completed a web development bootcamp and it was an amazing experience. The instructors were knowledgeable, the curriculum was well-structured. Highly recommend it to anyone looking to get into web development.",-,-
"Great course for anyone looking to delve into web development and web 3.0. Angela not only guides you meticulously through the material but also shares valuable do's and don'ts of web development. The course is structured exceptionally well for beginners, and those already at a beginner level can use it to progress to an intermediate level in various technologies. The learning curve of the course is linear, but it becomes steeper after reaching 70%, particularly at the API section. The course is regularly updated, and while the content on authentication is excellent, breaking down the 30-minute videos into 2-3 shorter ones would enhance the learning experience. Web 3.0 isn't that much necessary it can become a separate course, more material on JavaScript, node, express and react will be more valuable to students.",-,-
"After completing a web development course, my experience has been incredibly fulfilling and transformative. I gained a comprehensive understanding of web technologies and honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other relevant frameworks. Armed with this knowledge, I embarked on various projects, creating dynamic and visually appealing websites from scratch. The course not only equipped me with technical expertise but also instilled in me a problem-solving mindset and an eye for design. I became adept at troubleshooting code, optimizing website performance, and ensuring a seamless user experience. With each project, my confidence grew, and I now feel confident in pursuing a career as a web developer. The course provided me with a solid foundation and ignited a passion for creating impactful online experiences. I am excited to continue my journey and explore new possibilities in the ever-evolving world of web development.",-,-
"lots of content has outdated! and some function of sandbox.io can't be used, and the panel of it has totally changed. the Dev tools can't use, and some content is still 2017 or 2019, and you sell them in this year???",-,-
"Amazing! Angela is an awesome speaker/teacher and the projects in the course are really interesting and realistic. Thank you, Angela and her team, for making my dream to become a developer possible! <3",-,-
This course is incomplete and it cannot be followed from beginning to end. The database thought in this course is postgreSQL but the security and authentication section completely relies on mongoDB and the videos are on learning to use tools to interact with mongoDB entirely. The database section was updated from mongoDB to postgreSQL but the rest of the course wasn't making this course unusable,-,-
"She is very good at creating the course, but at this point of time (sept 2023) i am unable to follow her videos as she just went and deleted obsolete videos and didnt warn or do anything then she post a seperate link for old video, but after deleting the videos she didt post the new video in their place, there are few new videos , but you cant understand them if havenot studied the old videos , so basically if you wish to follow this couse you need to first study old course the start new couse , so basically this new course is forcefully inserted , angela you should have posted a new course with updated video and just sell it at a lowest price",-,-
"Angela Yu's full-stack web development course has its pros and cons. The HTML and CSS sections stand out for their clear explanations and thorough content coverage. However, the JavaScript portion, particularly the function section, falls short. Understanding how to return values can be challenging, and the examples provided may not always be helpful or relevant, leading to confusion instead of clarity.",-,-
"The course was a little bit old. Because without learning mongoose, we directly jumped into a section with mongoose. It was also tiresome to be forced to try the code in every single lecture. Sometimes we need some break. It kept hindering my motivation.",-,-
I'm actually a student of cs and i personally willed to enroll this course it's completely different than my thoughts means awesome level contents with projects and the instructor teaching method were really fantastic,-,-
"I recommend to take 100 days of code using Python then proceed to this bootcamp. Python will give you better understanding because of lesser code than Javascript. and also they have some same videos for basic HTML and some code, which is really good to think without looking at the solution. you can also see the difference when using else if statement.",-,-
"Nice course but doesn’t cover js in deep , advice will be to the students to practise a lot js before going through back end section , rest the course is good enough as it directly do projects and I like this approach",-,-
"The entire Authentication and Security section uses MongoDB when we were taught PostgreSQL. This makes it very hard to fall along. The Web3 chapters seem out of place here. No take of error handling. It would've been nice to bring everything together and build an app using our entire stack of technologies (a PERN stack), I don't quite know how to use them together using proper convention and error handling on a server. Also it would've been nice to learn NGINX. I still have no idea how to spin up a website or where to start filling in the gaps in my knowledge, though I did learn a lot about the technologies used. Otherwise I like the use of many projects and I still learned a lot.",-,-
"I made sure I understand every lesson before moving to the next, having to repeat many of them several times if I had to.  When I reached Lesson 146, I can't believe I couldn't understand what Angela was saying.  Looking at the comments section, everyone seems to be experiencing the same.  That lesson is poorly taught.",-,-
Great course for just starting out. I used this course as a rubric so I could dive more deeply in my own personal studies (a skill you will need to have to make it in this field). I highly recommend this course as a your first foray into the subject material.,-,-
"the entire course is good but some modules updated and there related modules are not updated like postgresql is updated but that related authentication module is not updated it is having mongodb only still like this some modules even more is there so,while updating something plz update the related modules also.",-,-
"Course is great and all explanations are clear. But there are several missed concepts. The React section don't cover everything like Router, useEffect and others. Even if they covered in Web3 section I think it would be better if it will be on React section too. In my opinion after this course not everyone will start carrer on Web3. It would be better if there are more big projects like building NFT Marketplace but combining React, PostgreSQL and NodeJS together. Some courses should be updated too but it is not big problem.",-,-
Thanks Angela. You were good at explaining things in such a simple way. You are very specific and really make every point or brace you put in clear. Your challenges have helped me a lot. in just 64 hours you managed to give a huge base worth 500. Thank you very much!,-,-
"I recently completed the web development bootcamp, and I can confidently say that it was an incredible learning experience. The curriculum was well-structured and covered all the essential topics in web development. The instructors were highly knowledgeable and passionate about teaching, which made the learning process engaging and enjoyable. Overall, the web development bootcamp exceeded my expectations. It provided me with a strong foundation in web development and equipped me with the skills necessary to pursue a career in this field. I highly recommend this bootcamp to anyone looking to learn web development in a supportive and comprehensive environment.",-,-
"Excelente curso. muy completo. Lo que mas rescato son los recursos que deja la profesora para enfocarse en el tema que estás aprendiendo (te ofrece el material inicial para que practiques lo recién aprendido). Para las personas que no se manejan  tan bien con el ingles, los subtitulos son muy buenos ya que la la profe modula bien y no acelera al hablar, aunque hay ciertas partes donde no se traduce tan bien y se desincroniza con el video, pero son pocas. Por ultimo, el modulo de autenticación no está actualizado ya que lo enseña con la base de datos ""mongodb"" y en el curso enseña postgres, además el modulo de React esta un poco desactualizado, puede que tengas problemas al usarlo en tu entorno local (recomiendo que el modulo React lo practiquen en sandbox),  esos puntos fueron los negativos.",-,-
"I enjoyed the course, it was funny, simple, and complete. However, in some videos, explanations were unclear, and I didn't understand the choice of teaching us Motoko and ICP instead of solidity or Ethereum.",-,-
Great course to start off my learning as a web developer. Angela is a great instructor and explains each section clearly. Some sections were out of date when I started but a lot has been recently updated and figuring out how to solve the issues on your own is part of the fun.,-,-
Great experience while reaching the end of this course. This will be great for those who don't know anything about web development and want to learn web development. I won't be able to explain how many headaches you can skip as a beginner while taking this course.,-,-
"Covers the basics well enough, the html,css, basic javascript. Course was not up to date enough. Could clearly see the staleness when it came to the later sections about the databases, authentication, and react.",-,-
"Some things like var don’t work in chrome anymore, so there are parts of the course that should be updated. She’s already added a lot of new content, but I wonder how often people get stuck. Still the best teacher around.",-,-
"Practical Project based learning is the best. I really get to know what , why and how did a execute a particular thing which is awesome for me. Thanks for the Guidance. Just a tip that course could have covered the some more theoretical concepts that were missed.",-,-
"The front end is explained well, Backend is a total mess with lots of errors in lesson codes. No proper updates to videos. It should not be marketed as a full stack if it is not updated with error-free codes.  Remember folks you get what you pay but it is a complete waste of time going through the MongoDB chapter. Everything just falling apart.",-,-
"Amazing content crisp and clear,the main thing like challenge because while trying to solve that challenge it is very helpful to search those things on internet and try and then see what the challenge answer and try to figure out that mistakes",-,-
"Un curso bastante completo, decidí verlo desde el comienzo a pesar de tener experiencia con bastantes de los temas que se ven y los temas me parecen muy bien desarrollados, sencillos de entender con las analogías que se muestran, las explicaciones tienen un tinte cómico por lo que el progreso es cómodo y la expositora es muy sincera con los detalles que implica cada sección, no basta con ver los videos, se deben realizar las prácticas (que son bastantes) y debes mostrar tu compromiso indagando por una respuesta por los diferentes medios que se proporcionan.",-,-
"As a software professional on the embedded side that has wanting to make a jump to the web side, this is EXACTLY what I was looking for. With that being said, it starts off at a perfect pace for a beginner as well, with plenty of challenges along the way to test and refine knowledge as it's gained instead of hurrying off to the next topic.",-,-
"fantastic online learning.  Teacher Angela explains the material clearly and simple, making analogy to common live events. The theory accompanied with the practical exercise will make sure that the learners grasp the idea.",-,-
"Course is not up to date, even though it is engaging. Backend needs to be updated more often. I managed to get through the course, but I had many obstacles which on the one side took me a lot of time, on the other I am now understanding things more clearly. So, its good, but far from best",-,-
I am facing difficulty in API authentication section the tasks which were provided with that and below that i wasnt able to complete it but i am trying my best to understand them so that in future i could learn all of them by practicing them.,-,-
"The course is exceptional at teaching the core concepts and providing examples, it still needs to be complemented with database managing (normalization), DevOps pipelines, and Agile development practices to become an integral web developer. The only really deprecative aspect is that some modules are outdated, the course instructs to use the versions listed, but sometimes they're not available anymore, and it's more important to learn the current version, since that's what would be expected when working. This is especially noticeable in the MongoDB and mongoose modules, where almost the whole module doesn't remotely resemble the current state of MongoDB and Mongoose.",-,-
I started taking this course at the beginning of the year but due to my exams I had to quit taking this course. I have started with the course again  and it's different compared to what it was at the beginning of the year and it has definitely improved for good. Judging on the videos so far it feels like the course is now more self practice oriented.,-,-
I am very thankful to Angela taught me very well but in my opinion this is a very good course for beginners who want to become only front-end web developers not full stack developers. I found this course very difficult to become a full stack web developer because I have zero knowledge about programming.,-,-
"Angela takes her time to explain a lot of the concepts and gives us the documentation so we can do further research.  My biggest complaint is not being able to report any bugs in the course.  Example: The username and password for the API Section 28 does NOT work.  Every username I try to enter returns an error saying ""username already taken"".  Please fix or give us a way we can contact you/your reps when we encounter these little 'annoyances'.  Thank you and keep up the otherwise exceptional work!",-,-
"Initially, I rated this course 5 stars and EVERYTHING was indeed 5 stars till authentication module where everythig was outdated and I thought it's just Authentication module and that's it BUT then React module came after where everything is so outdated that you cannot do a single thing from video without getting an error that says that way of doing it is outdated and no longer supported. I remember from Angela video that she once said that we should rethink twice before buying an outdated udemy course..Huge dissapointment at the end because I could not get a single full project from this course without not watching 8+ hours youtube tutorials to cover the holes from this course...",-,-
Everything is taught from scratch and build on to advanced topics. Very precise and clear cut knowledge by the video instructor to build the understanding. Thankyou @Dr. Angela Yu for providing such a beautiful course!!,-,-
"It's great and exciting! I am halfway through my learning. I would say, this is the most amazing e-learning I have ever experienced. There are a lot of new things I have learned as a full-stack web developer. Thanks for this great opportunity!",-,-
"Best course available on the internet at most affordable cost to learn the fundamentals of every technology which is used in building a web application. It is THE  BEST COURSE for BEGINNERS to learn Full Stack Web Development. But this course all by itself is not completely enough to be a web developer who earns good salary. Might need to take some extra courses on React JS and Next JS to be better employable. But none the less this is by far the best course at this cost covering most of the content what others do at say 10-20k Indian Rupees. So, if you are starting out definitely this Course is a NO BRAINER for you to buy and start learning Full Stack Web Development. And a HUGE THANKS to one of the best instructors I have come across since my schooling ANGELA YU. Thank you for creating this course on Udemy for everyone to learn Web Development. GREAT CONTENT.",-,-
After completing this course I feel confident. After lots of ups and down finally I completed this course. Thanks to you for this wonderful course and I hope that you always brings new things. This was very wonderful and knowledgeable journey.,-,-
Angela has been helping me to get to my educational goals. Having a outstanding teacher has helped me be successful in all of my current projects in her corse. I really love how easy she has made accessing further help on every project & I can go on my own time.,-,-
"This course is very well-structured, every new topic has a project to practically understand what you learnt which I liked very much personally . The teaching style and analogy used by Instructor Ma'am are very nice which helped me to understand concepts easily.",-,-
"before taking this course i was a studying coding just by finding long hours YouTube videos and others. but this course was a hidden Jem for me now i found it. it is concise and to the point above all it is time saver. thank you, Angela, for making this course, wish you best of luck in your endeavors!!!",-,-
"The tutor delivers exemplary presentations across all modules, demonstrating a profound understanding of the concepts. With mastery in simplifying complex ideas, she effectively conveys them in a manner accessible to individuals unfamiliar with computers, facilitating easy comprehension even for novices in the subject matter.",-,-
"I recently completed Angela's course, and I must say it was an outstanding experience. The course was incredibly engaging and entertaining throughout. Angela's teaching style is not only informative but also very enjoyable.",-,-
"Some topics are really well explained, with clear examples and do-able tasks to review the knowledge (like HTML, CSS, the first part of JS, DB), but suddenly, some parts get harder by x10, she just covered the knowledge very briefly and rushed to the tasks which are ridiculously hard (like advanced JS, server and API). So far I've crossed the middle point and still patient enough to grind everyday. Hope we can hang in there til the end=))",-,-
Detailed and good explanation of each concept. Provide add-ons to the projects from the beginning to the end. The videos consist of small and doable projects that help build up to the final projects.,-,-
"This being my first web development course, I felt a tremendous sense of accomplishment upon completing it, and I attribute this success to Angela Yu's exceptional teaching. While this course may not make you a fully-fledged developer, it certainly motivates you to explore further and equips you with valuable insights on how to learn, apply your knowledge, and identify areas for growth. It serves as an excellent introduction to the vast world of web development. Admittedly, the course content is somewhat outdated, necessitating the use of additional resources. Nevertheless, considering its price, this course is an absolute gem. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Angela for her mentorship and the impressive way she delivers her lessons.",-,-
Backend section is messed up. It feels like lot's of things are missing and facing many issues. Also why is there Web3 and blockchain lectures in the end. We could have learned a lot more about react or how to use backend with frontend.,-,-
Its a really really good course.great job.4.5/5 because that blockchain section didnt worked for me it said so many missing files in creating icp:(.hope there will be a update for that section.,-,-
"Yes, It was very nice course, nice explanation of content, only drawback i see is some(2-3) topics are not up to date they are outdated. But with some internet help you can learn them easily. Overall I say it's a nice course with good explanation of the topics.",-,-
"Very very well structured, and the best thing to me in this course is it's not about only learning web development from scratch and knowing the industry used jargons and best practices, but this course also teaches you to learn almost anything and many other useful stuffs. Lots of love for the instructor Dr. Angela Yu.",-,-
"The first few modules were AMAZING, easy to follow, and understandable. The pacing was great for us as beginners, which made us grasp the content and start training ourselves, linking what we learned every step of the way so easily. Once I reached the JavaScript section, it was as if another course had been just added to it or another instructor explaining things.",-,-
I've learned alot from this course this course is really amazing and i will recommend this course this to everyone who wanted to learn web development from beginner level. The things i like most about this course is structure of this course.,-,-
"The only thing i didn't like was that when i was doing this course all my technology versions were way ahead of what were used in this course and this lead to many many issues and problem. Even to some point that I had to leave that section and move forward. The most problematic sections were the website deploy, the crypto and the NFT ones.",-,-
"it is a tutorial that explains things in the simplest way possible like where the DR explained </html> as the bricks that's a really good example, being halfway made me realize that there are days when you gonna",-,-
"Overall a very good course, I have learned what I consider to be a substantial amount in the past 2.5 months. However much of the course isn't updated, and some lessons are completely broken as a result. If you apply yourself you can most definitely work through the issues. The instructor speaks British English and is very easy to understand.",-,-
"Algumas informações estão sendo atualizadas no começo e no fim do curso, porém tem coisas no meio dele que não foram ensinadas e, como ja foi atualizado no final, ela espera que você saiba, tendo que pesquisar muito para realizar as atividades, tirando isso é um ótimo curso",-,-
"The course started off great, I would have given it 5 stars. However, as the course progressed later on, there have been too many lectures that have not been updated in a long time, some even for years (react lecture is from 2019 for example), but the course is still advertised as the best 2023 course. In conclusion, too many outdated lectures that have many deprecated libraries, functions, software versions etc.",-,-
Angela's course is great and is fun to follow along. I can't provide a perfect score simply because some of the more important parts on the backend segment are outdated. Though I guess some would argue that the struggle to figure out the proper solution is part of the learning process. (It was stressful nonetheless),-,-
The course design and the learning flow are amazingly friendly. It is really helpful for a beginner to learn well on the fundamental knowledge and implementation with very clear explanations. The exercises helped to understand the concepts and can be completed in a reasonable time of thinking and disgesting.,-,-
Courses rapidly become out-dated. This one unfortunately is no different. The database segments in particular are outmoded as Mongoose has had a substantial release moving away from callback functions. Calling this a “2023” course is very mid-leading.,-,-
"My experience with this course was nothing short of exceptional and inspiring. I found every minute of the lessons extremely interesting and useful, especially since I have a deep passion for programming. The teacher had a unique and motivating teaching style that I had never encountered before in my educational journey; Her method was amazing and exceeded all expectations.",-,-
"An impressive course! It is very well structured, concise and very useful due to the practical part that requires the student's involvement in creating applications. I recommend this course!",-,-
Angela is the only person who made web development easy for me. I tried many free courses on youtube even in my native language but this course has taken me from scratch to a full web developer. Thank you Angela. I am happy to say that. My money did'nt got waste,-,-
"I'm really enjoying learning web development, especially since I come from a Mechanical background. Angela's teaching style is fantastic – she breaks down every step and concept so well. I believe these skills will boost my career.",-,-
"While listening to this lecture, you'll encounter many obstacles caused by outdated and neglected content. Angela will ignore them. This course is significantly outdated. If you don't want to waste your time, don't choose this lecture.",-,-
"I faced issues in following from MongoDB, because the course part is outdated. But anyways I managed to follow the course eventually with external help. I got a lot to learn from this course.",-,-
"Fantastic course with Angela as an outstanding instructor – undoubtedly one of the best I've enrolled in. Unfortunately, completion is hindered by the outdated React Session, currently running on React 16.",-,-
It was a really excellent course I learned a lot from it. Before taking this course I did not know anything about web development but after taking this course I can say that I am now web-developer,-,-
"For this price, it is an amazing course. It covers a wide range of programming knowledge, including GIT, CSS, JS, Node, DB, API, React, JQuery,  Web 3 and etc. The React section is a bit outdated, but the explanations are perfect! I have access to the Laracast platform, and I can make comparisons. In my opinion, Angela has created good practices and provided valuable resources for developers. It's a good starting point. However, I need new knowledge about the latest React 18 and a deeper dive into hooks, etc.",-,-
"The way Angela laid out the course plan was splendid! Easily a 5 star. I rated this a 3 star because the section of MongoDB until the end was outdated. Although I still recommend it to get started. You just need to find another tutorial regarding MongoDB, Deployment, and react.",-,-
"Overall, I really enjoy Angela's teaching style.  The exercises and projects really helped me understand the topics covered in this course.  My only complaint will be the large section of backend that was not up to date for 2023.  It required me to dig and find the right resources and answers to finish those sections, which in turn, helped me build those skill sets as a developer, but it was frustrating as someone new and learning.",-,-
I love the way Dr Angela made the Course interactive and she is constantly updating the contents. Her voice and method of teaching also made it easy for me to comprehend most of the concepts. Much Love Dr Angela❤️❤️,-,-
"Yet another exceptional course by Dr. Angela. I initially purchased this course in 2022 and have recently completed it this month. In 2022, I successfully tackled the backend section, employing its teachings across several projects. This course truly stands as a comprehensive and invaluable resource. It's worth noting that the course has been meticulously updated to align with the latest developments in the field.",-,-
The thing about this course is after you learn you dont learn how to apply everything together basically when you learn react you dont learn how to use it with node and postgres and the backend stuff so you kinda have to learn on your own afterwards,-,-
"A massive dose of information. Some a little backward but all in all a meaty and effective course. Angela is absolutely capable and knowledgeable, even inserting human side to her lectures.",-,-
"The course is good ! BUT I think when teaching everything together is best than separate topics , example creating projects that uses all tecnologies in one project its hard to get on beginning but good to have every thing in a same project , a project like Social Network would be great , I dont know if it exists in the next lessons , but so far has been good , Thanks",-,-
Amazing course. Angela prepared everything for better understanding and explaining all basis in a way that will keep in your mind forever. Also all the information is usefull and updated for the latest tecnologies uses in the market right now. I recomend it 100%,-,-
Angela has so much enthusiasm and it comes across in everything she says. Content is very interesting and informative - need to move on to the next lesson as soon as the last one has finished.,-,-
"The way of teaching is exceptionally good, learning with examples and doing practice of each lessons are really needed in the field of programming, The content and explanation are from the scratch , that is the best part of this course.",-,-
"I thoroughly enjoyed this course. Anglea does a wonderful job of teaching the contents of this course and everything is well explained. The only complaint I have is that, the content of some modules taught here are outdated and not really useful in the current scenario (eg the react module is pretty outdated and slow), and the projects could have been better and more practical. Apart from that, this bootcamp is very near to my heart and I'm very grateful for all it has taught me. Thank you Angela for this bootcamp.",-,-
"I was searching for the same content on youtube and google but was unable to get but after learning from this video its become very easy for me to understand and now i am able to implement it in my website ,thanks for such great efforts.",-,-
"It was really fun learning to be a web developer but I had a lot of problems, sometimes I didn't understand the programming logic and sometimes I felt frustrated because my program didn't work. So I really repeated a lot of explanations so it could be said that my progress was not that fast. However, I felt this was the challenge and I continued to progress and learn until I became a junior web developer in the future.",-,-
"overall the course is great but the only problem I have faced is with mongodb, because there's old videos of it and the new version contains a lot of changes which have made it hard to do anything.",-,-
"Most parts of the course are outdated. Somehow, towards the end, she delves into NFTs, Blockchain, and other topics (also outdated—you'll lose a lot of time on the ICP forum seeking solutions), while failing to provide proper explanations for JS or React. While you can learn a lot, you'll need to put in a significant amount of extra personal effort to fully grasp everything. If you're a beginner, I believe this course might not be very beneficial for you.",-,-
"The course itself is really good and in depth. It takes a lot of time and energy and dedication but Angela is a great instructor! However, what I am missing so far (i am at 3/4 of the course) are informations to deployment and real world application. For static Websites there are a lot of options, but as soon as the course dives into node.js and Databases you are left with nothing more than just having small projects on your computer. What If I want to deploy them somewhere? In my mind its one of the most basic informations that nobody teaches and it takes away a lot of the fun one would have by not letting you create real world projects. Im still hoping that there will be some information on this subject, but so far nothing - and in my mind it should be mentioned multiple times.",-,-
"Angela, you are so sweet and kind, but I was expecting a beginner friendly course. I hate the fact that we don't code along with you and I hate the fact that you expect us to solve an exercise before you showing us how to do it. It's like you expect a child to eat by himself, but he never was taught how...",-,-
"The best course offered on Web Development on the internet. Am not just saying this, but I feel it! I have taken few other courses offered by this instructor and have excelled in my domain, therefore, I am confident it's gonna be fun and fun LEARNING!",-,-
Because it's very help full for me. When I start this course I just know about the HTML and CSS but letter on I got to much from this course. And it helps me to be the one in my life. I just start but now I can do much more in my Web career. And I give four star because of one or two module are not completely update.,-,-
"Although the course is very good, but i expected some more topics covered like context in react and a capstone on react is also missing although that's not necessary, also django is missing in this course which should be a necessary part of the course as it is also a great part of any webd course. i know i am greedy here, but i think must go through the Q&A section and you will find a lot like this. Again thanks a lot for so much hard work..",-,-
I like the amount of small exercises that let you practice immediately after the explanation (pause video and try yourself). The exercises work better than the quizzes that you see in some other courses. I like this course better than one other Udemy Web course that I tried but didn't finish. I also like the pep talks at the end of each chapter.,-,-
The course contents are excellent and they contain all the necessary things which you are seeking & angella has made things really easier for us through this course. She has explained the things really well.,-,-
"This is the worst course I have ever taken in my entire life. The videos are very old, there are no resources, some resources don't work anymore, and the websites it recommends no longer exist. As you watch videos, the instructor removes them randomly, and the videos are all messed up. This course is a total waste of time. There are so many better courses available for free.",-,-
"Awesome course! Everything is expressed an explained straight to the point. I come from learning how to code from books which gives a deeper understanding, I wish that I started out with her videos to save time. I moved from books to this course for the exercises, quizzes and projects to make sure that I utilize, practice, and retain the material.",-,-
"I'm going through the Intermediate CSS and so far all the new updates you've made has been amazing and above my expectations. I've completed the version of CSS before this and it didn't do a good enough job diving deeper. I haven't found a course that did a great job teaching a concept that could be overly complicated, made so simple. Thank you and great job!",-,-
"Everything is awesome, but as a mobile user I'm unable to do coding exercises, if there is anything that mobile users install and do coding exercises, please do mention it,it will help a lot.",-,-
"in the html and css section everything was clear. but starting with the first lesson of js I fell out of the process completely. i understood but could not perform any task because to solve it you need to know something that was not in the lesson. nevertheless, i continue to take the course with the hope that i will understand or learn on youtube.",-,-
"There is a big mismatch and midway updates in some of the course contents . Meanwhile you replaced the section of Mongoose DB with a new section for Postgres DB,  the subsequent sections are talking heavily about the usage of Mongoose. Not Only that but Mongoose is kept as a main part of code structure in Authentication and Security Section and left us suffering either skip this part or searching for proper solutions.",-,-
"Really good course, you need to dig in on some documentation because the outdated data, but this helps to improve your skills on reading the documentation the proper way. 100% recommended.",-,-
there are many new things i did learn and there are some difficult is but i follow Angela's lead and try to understand everything. some times i stop this course and watch another to clarify information i got here but overall this course is very useful,-,-
"This course is excellent and a great introduction to web development but beware of the fact that there are some modules and exercises that work poorly and would definitely need some updates. There are exercises with answers already written in them, and course material can be quite broken here and there so you cannot always be sure if you're just too dumb or the exercise broken so you waste hours of your life only to discover later that you did nothing wrong but that there's something wrong with the API or there's one line of code that's broken and you need to repair the prewritten code for the exercise to work properly.",-,-
"Without a doubt, this is hands down the most exceptional web development course available!  No need to pay Rs 25000 - 50000 to join any institute to learn web development. You can buy this course for Rs 450-550 with an udemy offer.",-,-
"I was a little intimidated when I saw everything that this course covers.  However, it was easy to follow and delivered in an upbeat method that encourages the student to actually try the examples.  I learned many things that I am eager to begin implementing.",-,-
"Mrs. Yu is the best lecturer I have learned from, she is eloquent & has a lot to offer. This is the first time I learned coding and through her guidance, I have been able to develop a few web applications and websites, which have been praised to be grade.",-,-
"just a average course, she just ask you to read other documentation for even basic concepts and because other documentation aren't for beginners, you need external sources like other youtube channels to understand. there is room for lots of improvement in the course.",-,-
"The course has complicated topics in it, a few classes might be confusing, but overall Dr Angela explains things in a clear, concise manner, and she's always pushing people to keep going by the end of each module. Thoroughly recommend it.",-,-
"Halfway through the course I lowered my grade, and then it will be seen, maybe I will raise it further. In general, the course is a good guide to the order of studying technologies and their parts. However, much of the information in the course is outdated (some of it has been out of date for several years). I'm now on the jQuery section, which is much less used now (let's see if version 4.0, released the other day, will change the situation), and Angela doesn't make notes in the middle of the course to let us know what information is really up to date. The JavaScript section is quite confusing and not very clearly explained, which is what many people complain about in the comments.",-,-
"It is a good course for beginners but there are sections that need a lot of updating. Especially MongoDB and Mongoose sections need to be updated. Other sections are generally up to date. I was confused in some parts and thought about quitting, but I pushed myself and continued. For those who are thinking of buying the course, there will be parts where you will be confused and you will have to push yourself and do research. I wish everything will be as you want. Thank you for everything Dr. Angela Yu ?",-,-
"Lots of interesting content well presented but outdated a lot, also the resources like exercises (Starting files) are not available...  The amazing community of learners is helping by providing some material they saved while the content was available so its still possible to follow as of today. And by following the documentation online its possible to update the code provide in order to complete the exercises.",-,-
I am a manager working to refresh my knowledge and get back into hands-on development. This course has been amazing in how it is structured and how it guides me through concepts. This is what I needed and more.,-,-
this course id completely shit and wasting time and wasting money she bring just some written code and explains some part of that you will never learn any thing with this course even i thing she don't know any thing i did not write any code even they told 30 days money back i can not a refund request,-,-
"I have purchased several other courses on this very platform, and among all of them, this course was the best one that I felt like the best purchase. Reasons are because, in almost every video, first she teaches and then there's a challenge in almost every video, which makes the student do it himself/herself by researching and going through previous lessons. So far I love this course.",-,-
"Thank you, Angela Ma'am, for the invaluable course. I am very satisfied with this course. I am currently progressing through the most difficult modules, and I believe they will be explained as effectively as the previous ones. I have completed the blog project under the legacy course instruction, and it was truly a valuable module. Please consider including it in the new version, as it contains many important elements. Students may not immediately recognize its significance. The decision I made to join this course is one of the best decisions I have taken in my life. Thank you so much.",-,-
"This course has been amazing for me to learn the fundamentals and I think it has been designed in a way for us to get stuck , read a few doc , try to figure it out and move on . Great Job !!",-,-
"The first half of this course is good but as many people have stated, once you hit section 33 it's 5 years out of date and a lot of the instructions don't work anymore. And later modules are based on what you learn in 33 so this is a nightmare to complete.",-,-
"Ich bin total zufrieden mit dem Aufbau des Kurses, mit der Didaktik und den Lernbeispielen. Angela ist super angenehm und es macht sehr viel Spaß Ihr zu folgen. Mit Ihrer Art motiviert Sie mich bei jedem Video weiterzumachen.",-,-
"It was an excellent experience to learn from you and basically, I am a Mechanical engineering graduate still getting all your lectures. The way you explain thing is very easy to understand your examples or projects are very useful.",-,-
"After some points you realize that the lessons is too old for 2023, but don't worry in the comment and Q&A section there are a lot of answers to questions if you struggle with the old lessons, Over All its a 10/10 course and I Love Angela. She is the best teacher in the whole world",-,-
"This course is exceptionally well-structured, making complex concepts easily comprehensible. The teacher consistently fosters an inspiring learning environment, motivating students to actively engage in their studies.",-,-
"The course content is great, and although there is some content that is not up to date with the latest versions of some libraries the course examples and exercises are great to learn and apply the knowledge on functional applications.",-,-
It is great experience with the course. The reason of giving four star because this course did not come with the notes to revise them. If you started out giving the notes in pdf format it would be very great.,-,-
"Coming from a non-technical background even the thought of diving into the engineering aspects of a dynamic website was gruesome and daunting, however, Angela and this course made it really easy for me to embark on this journey, and post-completion I can easily say that this is by far the best course for Web development. The curriculum is super structured and the exercises have a gradual learning curve, which helps one ease into the subject matter. Thank you so much for this amazing course, Angela!! Looking forward to joining you on similar courses in the future!!!! :)",-,-
"Not only is a very complete course, the way is explanined is so fun, didactic and detailed. No extra music on the background, a pleasant voice pitch and the diction of the teacher is just perfect.",-,-
"Best course ever for web development. No one can match the level of her efforts that she put in making this course. After completion of this course , you will be capable for freelancing. She taught the front end and back end very well. The best thing about this course is that she keep updating the course time to time.",-,-
"This course is a mix of many tools and frameworks, way too many even for a full-stack developer. The course is not suitable for a beginner, and not because it covers advanced topics, but because it's a mishmash of everything that only confuses you. For a beginner, this mix is not beneficial at all. I recommend beginners to focus heavily on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Look for courses that don't mix too much if you want to learn effectively, and you'll be much more focused and motivated.",-,-
"Personally , this is an perfect course for me because I have watched tons of youtube videos and lectures based on Full stack development . This help to understand the concept easier than the materials i have been through.",-,-
The course is so awesome and it’s actually what it was said to be before I bought the course. I really enjoyed and learned a lot from Dr. Angela through her unique style of teaching programming and i also enjoyed her funny jokes.... Lol,-,-
"Loved the course! At times it seemed like, Angela didn't describe all the important concepts in depth, but in the following module all became more clear. I feel like i have enough knowledge to start creating my own projects. Thank you so much for the course!",-,-
"This has been one of the best courses I've ever taken of anything I've ever learned. Not only is this a great video series, where if you are like me where I visually learn, but Angela does a great job breaking things down to simplest form.",-,-
"Es una excelente introducción al mundo de desarrollo web, nomas le bajo un poco porque hay mucho material que está desactualizado, y realmente toma mucho tiempo el corregirlo y pasar sobre los bugs para recien comenzar a trabajar.",-,-
"This course is a great start for beginners delving into web development, as it encompasses a wide range of tools with just enough information and practical knowledge to keep you engaged and learning and not be intimidated and run away.",-,-
"thank you for this course, this is my first time to learn the IT skills so i got the knowledge in HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT for beginner and advanced , but at backend site i have again some difficulty that i must improve more in order to solve it.",-,-
"Angela is a gem. if you are reading this comment to decided if you should buy the course or not then just go buy it without wasting any time . I think this is the best Investment ive ever made . i spent a lot of money on learning JS but this course makes the most sense . Im at Drum Kit project right now and i think if i keep learning the way i am learning, i am not that far away from getting a job .",-,-
HTML and CSS if very nicely covered but later sections are recorded more than 4 years back and now each and everything has updated so much that it became a pathetic experience to follow this course. This course should be updated totally or should not be named as web development bootcamp 2023?,-,-
"The course is great up until she starts to contradict herself. At some point during the course, she showed a graph indicating why PHP is no longer a viable language to learn because the popularity graph shows a decline in usage. Then she starts teaching EJS which is virtually vanishing. The course is fractured and not well organized. If you want javascript, buy a javascript course and not one that is all over the place.",-,-
"Considering this course's price range, I believe it provides a great value, but some topics and modules are missing. For instance, in this course they did not make a complete Mern stack app, and at some point the course is not very up to date. The overall experience is great, and it gives you a good idea of how a complete website works, as well as how she taught it. For creating such an amazing course at such an affordable price, I would like to thank you.",-,-
"Me ha ayudado mucho a entender fundamentos y porder aplicarnos, la profesora es excelente explicando y tiene ejercicios divertidos y funcionales. Además me encanta que da una visión de cómo ser programador en la vida real",-,-
Really enjoying breezing through this course. I am a pretty experienced programmer however this course has yet so much to offer. Dr. Angela Yu does a phenomenal job explaining difficult topics like a piece of cake. Her enthusiasm and teaching skills make this learning experience fun and a walk in the park! Cheers & happy coding!,-,-
"The best part is when you are challenged with a module, and you tackle it without any help. Frustrating your mind while working on it, and after successfully running the server or web app, the happiness it brings. It was my first time; I actually felt like I learned to code by myself through brainstorming. All credits to Dr. Angela Yu ~ Best starting course for web development if you haven't learned Html, CSS only, so from my side I will give the course overall a 4/5 (-1 just for Javascript).",-,-
"This is the third course I have taken from Angela and it's as always highly interesting and project-oriented, if you want to gain leadership in the web realm just take the course and work hard. It's worth the money.",-,-
"11/2023: The first half of the course was okay and fun. I enjoyed HTML, CSS and JS beginnings. But once u get to the backend stuff and more advanced JS, the learning curve seemed too steep, if you a complete beginner. I switched to a different course and I am very happy about it. Repeating some stuff and learning new details that were not mentioned in this course. Understanding basics and having solid knowledge foundations, is super important otherwise all will become a word soup in the end. So, look around and see which course suits you the best. Also, this course should NOT have been named 2023 Web Bootcamp because some stuff is not updated. Anyway, Angela, thank you.",-,-
"it was very good,Angela is a great teacher but most of her course is not updated expescially mongodb module in latest update call back function is removed so this made me little uneasy in this module rest of module was fine",-,-
"The video on Udemy runs slowly, even with a good internet connection. It seems like there might be an issue with the buffering speed or scalability, making it difficult to watch the course smoothly. Could you please check and improve the video streaming speed for a better learning experience? Day 10 and videos are still not working properly...",-,-
"once I started to make it further into the course it started to become more vague and go along the lines of we haven't learnt this but try it, now here's the solution. so instead of teaching parts you just get told what was done and shown a full solution",-,-
outdated mongodb section and overall outdate course.you can still use this as a guide by reading new documentation for the respective tech and looking at new comments can help you find solution,-,-
"Angella, I first learnt of you when I was learning flutter through a free course on YouTube. Your smiles, personality, and easy-to-understand accent made it very easy for me to learn everything you were teaching in that course.",-,-
"The front end is explained well, Backend is a total mess with lots of errors in lesson codes. No proper updates to videos. It should not be marketed as a full stack if it is not updated with error-free codes. Remember folks you get what you pay but it is a complete waste of time going through the MongoDB chapter. Everything just falling apart.",-,-
"This is an absolute winner! From coding essentials to advanced techniques like React and databases, it's a comprehensive package. Engaging content, projects, and supportive answers seal the deal. A must for budding web developers. :D",-,-
"It's definitely worth it to buy this course. Specially i was struggling one of the important topics in programming API that Angela deep dive into this field. She taught both frontend and backend topics detailed, subtitle is clear. Teaching process is fun, Angela's advertisement is valuable at the end of each section and keep motivate me. I highly recommend this course to new beginners.",-,-
"She is an excellent teacher and she really explained each thing in a way that made it easy to grasp and put into practice. I only give 3 stars because there are parts of the course that are so outdated that they are almost unlearnable. Specifically the section on databases. I know she is currently working on updating everything, so if she has then I would highly recommend the course.",-,-
Angela Rocks !! I love the way she explains everything and how she progressively explains less and lets us do the rest. I’ve already take 10. Days of code: The complete python pro bootcamp and I loved it. Now enjoying this other course too.,-,-
"Half the course is pretty well written and really though out, the problem is the other half, capstone project of section 26 shows how this course really drifts over, the title itself has nothing to do with what you are really asked to do in this project, moreover you don't even have the knowledge yet to implement what is asked, I had great hopes for this course but I ended up being disappointed.",-,-
definitely this course is the easiest and most simplified to learn complex concept with precision . i would easily rate it a 10/10. The number of examples and projects and their solution makes it a fun and encouraging journey.,-,-
It is on of the best course for Full Stack Web Development. Happy to enroll for this course. Explanation of all things are very good. Got to know new the tools and technology in the current market.,-,-
"This course is best for beginners who want to know the basics of web designing. It may not have some advanced topics that are not necessary for understanding basics. My only suggestion is certification is only provided for completed full courses, I requested the Author provide different types of certificates for front-end, back-end and full-stack. It will also help to attract more students, that's my humble request thankyou.",-,-
"I enrolled in Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp 2023 with high hopes after completing the initial 32 sections, which were relatively up to date and well-structured. However, my experience took a nosedive once I reached Section 33, which focused on MongoDB.",-,-
"The best web development online bootcamp money can get, the instructor is great and friendly, the course is engaging overall I am so happy that I took this course. Thank you, Dr. Angela Yu and Greetings from Egypt, :).",-,-
"I would say, this course is very amazing and at the same time an eye-opener because according to my experience with it and my previous state in programming, this course has greatly improved my skills and enlightened me with the assistance of practical projects which has helped me have clarity of my path as a developer and as well achieve my goals. For that, I take this opportunity to appreciate my instructor Dr. Angela Yuo who made this course fun and inspirational for easy understanding for anyone out there who's willing to learn programming. Thank you, Madam Angela.",-,-
"Really great course! Angela does an amazing job with pacing the difficulty of the content, explaining abstract concepts in easy to grasp ways, challenging you to go beyond your capabilities, while cheering you on along the way!",-,-
"The updated portions of the course are amazing.  Very clear instructions and excellent practice Challenges and Capstone projects.  However, on difficult topics such as getting started installing MongoDB, the course is so far out of date that it is useless.  Trying to get started by using the documentation is almost impossible because the have so many links and different concepts to try and learn/follow from the docs its extremely complex and non-inuitive.  Especially the fact that the ""mongo"" command is deprecated and no longer works combined with the need to install the mongosh in order to interact with the DB it all very confusing.  Especially since Mongo pushes people towards the cloud-based Atlas service with compass as a GUI.",-,-
"This is the Best Online Web Development tutorial and my experience while learning concepts in this tutorial was great ,easy to learn things and you can get practice projects the end of every lesson to make it better for learning . So overall it was a good experience.",-,-
"When I first purchased this course, I had actually purchased many different courses before or experienced them on YouTube. But these topics, which were already incredibly boring to me as a Computer Engineering student (Believe me, I don't know why :D), now became unbearable thanks to the narrators, and at one point I completely stopped learning these concepts. Then I came across this course and when the price was on sale, I thought, ""Why not?"" I said and bought it suddenly :D. And I have to tell you, Angela is truly an incredible storyteller. The course is taught so well that I don't think it is possible for you to get bored. The sites he recommends and the tasks given, whether short or long, are quite descriptive, and I think the best thing is that each task is explained step by step, making the work to be done much more understandable and clear. This course was a course that I found by chance and I liked it incredibly. Thank you Angela for this wonderful course :3. Because you managed to break a taboo for me. I look forward to checking out some of your other courses!",-,-
"Pretty easy to understand they the teacher explains everything, even if you are a complete beginner, this is all you need to go from basic to intermediate, then, of course, you need to figure out how to become a better programmer.",-,-
"Dr. Yu is clearly a knowledgeable, expert explainer - and has earned the respect of the title. But she is relaxed and approachable enough that she seems even more like ""Angela"" - which makes the course fun and even more effective.",-,-
"Flow structure is good, but the course only touches the surface of every section not much focus on details. It feels like we are memorizing the portion of the course making me unable to make a simple website on our own",-,-
Since then I'm looking for good online tutorials about this course. Very clear and easy to understand. If something that's not clear on this course. There's a lot of hint or useful information on this course that you can use to search in internet when you get stuck. Highly recommended to everyone who wants to learn web programming.,-,-
"I appreciate the challenges I'm encouraged to solve on my own and the solutions offered. In addition, the course material is spot on, and all of this comes together to deliver a fun step-by-step experience.",-,-
It's a very comprehensive course in terms of the topics covered. But I think the quality of the javascript section in this course is not upto the mark. There are lots of think which are important but are not covered eg. Promise API.,-,-
"I actually enrolled for Cole's course for web development, as I already took Angela's iOS development course, I wanted to learn from some other instructor. But not even a single day, I had to refund and enroll in Angela's Web Development course. Your way of teaching is very good Anglea!",-,-
"Idk if im dumb but she explains well, doesnt bother explaining things that arent revelant to the current level we are at, and keeps things simple, challenging somewhat, but within the range of, oh ok I dont want to quit this yet.",-,-
really helpfull this course helped me alot in the web development course in the university in addition it helped me with some topics in my database course and advanced object oriented programing thank you so much angela,-,-
"I really loved this course. Angela's teaching style is very engaging, and it feels as though she is speaking directly to you at times. She explains the concepts very well and provides challenges along the way to practice what you've just learned. I very much enjoyed this course, and I hope that she teaches courses on other development technologies soon.",-,-
"It's definitely challenging, but I'm able to understand and continue with the modules. I can't know for sure if I'll be able to successfully become a software engineer, but if I don't, it will be on me because the Instructor is teaching good, giving many examples and exercises. So far I'm happy with this course.",-,-
Angela is a perfect teacher!! She doesn't waste your time and focuses on what's important. Every aspect of this course is on point and will teach you from scratch how to start on Web Developing!!,-,-
I have tried coding before but always found it difficult to maintain the pace and understand/practice the content. This course is well design to progressively take you through the coding concept without feeling like it is impossible!,-,-
"Course has really opened up my knowledge and breaks everything down into simple easy to learn steps, does a fantastic job as not just showing what the things are but also defining every crumb along the way. wonderful work and thank you so much for sharing your knowledge and allowing me to be a better developer!",-,-
"The best course out there for web development, this is entirely beginner friendly and goes to advanced. Loving the course can see the effort put on the course to make it easy for us to grab the concepts",-,-
"I had refunded this course the first time, but there were some resources she offered that were helpful. Other than that, she wastes whole tutorials on single tags vs grouping tags. Even some tags she's not even covered, so confused if she will ever cover them?",-,-
"She is an amazing teacher! Angela's teaching is outstanding. It's easy to understand, her pronunciation is clear, and even though English isn't my native language, I can follow along easily. Her valuable tips and motivational words are a great help for my learning. I highly recommend her lectures.",-,-
"The course is good however the react module is a bit outdated and let to a lot of wastage of time, except for that i also wanted to learn mongo from this course as its a necessity but there is no module about monogdb.",-,-
Yes it is match up for me. The best tip i got so far is to understand concept for 10 minutes and to replicate what you got rather than coding together with tutorial. Because i was that kind of person.,-,-
"Really easy to grasp coming from Dr. Angela Yu. Keeps you engaged, grabs your attention, but also teaches you. Can't ask for a better course than one with those features in my opinion. A huge bonus is the certificate and the amount of content it comes with.",-,-
great course for intermediate programmers but not for beginner i guess cause some topics of advancejava script has OOPS concept that means the person who didnt know programming language before would not understand.,-,-
"I have found this course both informative and productive. The lessons in addition to the code challenges and Capstone projects, really give a full developer experience and help you to learn challenging concepts.",-,-
"basic are good but its an outdated course topics such as API,ROUTING OF NODE.In React no concept hooks,there is no integration of react and node .In this way this course simple thing much complex we have to browse from internet and its time consuming .please go for an updated course for s2023",-,-
"I started this course a month ago. I found this interesting till the end of frontend module. As of now the backend modules are completely outdated. The frontend section is amazing as it's up to date. but the backend lectures are from 2018 and the technologies are changed. So, I request to check the course backend section at the time of your purchase. Again, if you want to become a frontend developer you can go for it. Please update the course as soon as possible.",-,-
"so far I am at 35th and the lecture doesn't taught attributes, like the tutor just use some attributes that newbies don't even have an idea about. rest everything is going great, it's well organized and well explained everything.",-,-
