review,summary
HTML and CSS if very nicely covered but later sections are recorded more than 4 years back and now each and everything has updated so much that it became a pathetic experience to follow this course. This course should be updated totally or should not be named as web development bootcamp 2023?,"The customer felt disappointed with the course due to outdated information, which made it difficult to keep up with current industry developments."
"Initially, I rated this course 5 stars and EVERYTHING was indeed 5 stars till authentication module where everythig was outdated and I thought it's just Authentication module and that's it BUT then React module came after where everything is so outdated that you cannot do a single thing from video without getting an error that says that way of doing it is outdated and no longer supported. I remember from Angela video that she once said that we should rethink twice before buying an outdated udemy course..Huge dissapointment at the end because I could not get a single full project from this course without not watching 8+ hours youtube tutorials to cover the holes from this course...","The customer was initially extremely satisfied with the course, but after encountering outdated modules and errors, their experience turned sour. Despite investing significant time, they couldn't complete a single full project due to the numerous gaps in the provided content."
"Best course ever for web development. No one can match the level of her efforts that she put in making this course. After completion of this course , you will be capable for freelancing. She taught the front end and back end very well. The best thing about this course is that she keep updating the course time to time.","A student expressed their enthusiastic approval of a web development course, praising its instructor for their high effort and ability to effectively teach both frontend and backend skills. They felt the course was highly valuable, providing the necessary skills to pursue freelancing."
"The course is good ! BUT I think when teaching everything together is best than separate topics , example creating projects that uses all tecnologies in one project its hard to get on beginning but good to have every thing in a same project , a project like Social Network would be great , I dont know if it exists in the next lessons , but so far has been good , Thanks","The customer found the course to be generally good, but thought that separating topics might have made learning easier. They suggested creating projects that integrate multiple technologies to help build a stronger foundation."
"just a average course, she just ask you to read other documentation for even basic concepts and because other documentation aren't for beginners, you need external sources like other youtube channels to understand. there is room for lots of improvement in the course.","The reviewer found this online course average and felt that it relied too heavily on additional resources beyond the official documentation, making it inaccessible to beginners. They also suggested significant improvements were needed to elevate the learning experience."
"I completed a web development bootcamp and it was an amazing experience. The instructors were knowledgeable, the curriculum was well-structured. Highly recommend it to anyone looking to get into web development.","The reviewer had a very positive experience with the web development bootcamp, praising the instructors' knowledge and the structured curriculum."
"This course is best for beginners who want to know the basics of web designing. It may not have some advanced topics that are not necessary for understanding basics. My only suggestion is certification is only provided for completed full courses, I requested the Author provide different types of certificates for front-end, back-end and full-stack. It will also help to attract more students, that's my humble request thankyou.","This course excelled in teaching web design basics to beginners, but fell short by not covering advanced topics or offering customized certification options. The reviewer suggests providing separate certifications for front-end and back-end skills to better cater to students' needs."
"This course has been amazing for me to learn the fundamentals and I think it has been designed in a way for us to get stuck , read a few doc , try to figure it out and move on . Great Job !!","The customer found this course to be incredibly helpful in learning the basics, enjoying its challenging yet self-paced nature. They praised the course's design, which encourages students to learn through trial and error."
Angela has been helping me to get to my educational goals. Having a outstanding teacher has helped me be successful in all of my current projects in her corse. I really love how easy she has made accessing further help on every project & I can go on my own time.,"Angela's exceptional teaching and support have significantly contributed to the reviewer's success, making complex courses manageable and accessible. She provides a personalized learning experience that fosters independence and flexibility."
"This is the third course I have taken from Angela and it's as always highly interesting and project-oriented, if you want to gain leadership in the web realm just take the course and work hard. It's worth the money.","The reviewer highly recommends a course by Angela, describing it as engaging and project-based, with valuable insights for those seeking leadership in online spaces. They praise its value for the price and suggest taking it if you want to succeed in this field."
"before taking this course i was a studying coding just by finding long hours YouTube videos and others. but this course was a hidden Jem for me now i found it. it is concise and to the point above all it is time saver. thank you, Angela, for making this course, wish you best of luck in your endeavors!!!","The reviewer had a transformative experience with the online course, finding it to be concise, efficient, and game-changing after spending hours searching for coding tutorials on YouTube. They praised Angela's creation as a hidden gem that saved them time and effort."
Angela's course is great and is fun to follow along. I can't provide a perfect score simply because some of the more important parts on the backend segment are outdated. Though I guess some would argue that the struggle to figure out the proper solution is part of the learning process. (It was stressful nonetheless),"Angela's course is engaging and enjoyable, but has a minor drawback due to outdated information in one section."
I am a manager working to refresh my knowledge and get back into hands-on development. This course has been amazing in how it is structured and how it guides me through concepts. This is what I needed and more.,"The reviewer found the course to be well-structured, guiding them effectively through key concepts and helping them refresh their knowledge and get back into hands-on development."
"Pretty easy to understand they the teacher explains everything, even if you are a complete beginner, this is all you need to go from basic to intermediate, then, of course, you need to figure out how to become a better programmer.","The reviewer found the teaching style to be clear and easy to follow, making it accessible even for beginners. The teacher's explanations helped them progress from basics to an intermediate level, but ultimately emphasized that further practice is needed to improve their programming skills."
"She is an amazing teacher! Angela's teaching is outstanding. It's easy to understand, her pronunciation is clear, and even though English isn't my native language, I can follow along easily. Her valuable tips and motivational words are a great help for my learning. I highly recommend her lectures.","The customer highly recommends Angela's teaching, praising its clarity, effectiveness, and motivation. She finds Angela to be an excellent teacher who has made English learning easy and accessible, despite not being her native language."
"For this price, it is an amazing course. It covers a wide range of programming knowledge, including GIT, CSS, JS, Node, DB, API, React, JQuery,  Web 3 and etc. The React section is a bit outdated, but the explanations are perfect! I have access to the Laracast platform, and I can make comparisons. In my opinion, Angela has created good practices and provided valuable resources for developers. It's a good starting point. However, I need new knowledge about the latest React 18 and a deeper dive into hooks, etc.","Customer found the course to be an excellent value for its price, covering a broad range of programming topics, but noted that some sections are slightly outdated. The instructor's good practices and resources are beneficial, but may not provide enough depth for advanced learners like the customer seeking specific knowledge in newer technologies like React 18."
"There is a big mismatch and midway updates in some of the course contents . Meanwhile you replaced the section of Mongoose DB with a new section for Postgres DB,  the subsequent sections are talking heavily about the usage of Mongoose. Not Only that but Mongoose is kept as a main part of code structure in Authentication and Security Section and left us suffering either skip this part or searching for proper solutions.","The customer was frustrated with a mismatch between course content updates, specifically a replacement section on Postgres DB and continued focus on Mongoose in later sections, which conflicted with their understanding of the code structure."
"She is very good at creating the course, but at this point of time (sept 2023) i am unable to follow her videos as she just went and deleted obsolete videos and didnt warn or do anything then she post a seperate link for old video, but after deleting the videos she didt post the new video in their place, there are few new videos , but you cant understand them if havenot studied the old videos , so basically if you wish to follow this couse you need to first study old course the start new couse , so basically this new course is forcefully inserted , angela you should have posted a new course with updated video and just sell it at a lowest price","The customer was initially pleased with Angela's video creation, but had a frustrating experience with the latest update of her course. The removal of old videos caused confusion, making it difficult to follow without rewatching previous material, prompting the customer to question Angela's strategy."
"Very very well structured, and the best thing to me in this course is it's not about only learning web development from scratch and knowing the industry used jargons and best practices, but this course also teaches you to learn almost anything and many other useful stuffs. Lots of love for the instructor Dr. Angela Yu.","The customer loved the structured approach and comprehensive nature of the course, which taught them not just web development but also how to learn effectively and adapt to various situations."
"I started this course a month ago. I found this interesting till the end of frontend module. As of now the backend modules are completely outdated. The frontend section is amazing as it's up to date. but the backend lectures are from 2018 and the technologies are changed. So, I request to check the course backend section at the time of your purchase. Again, if you want to become a frontend developer you can go for it. Please update the course as soon as possible.","The reviewer was initially engaged with the course, particularly in the frontend module, but became disenchanted after discovering that the backend modules were outdated and no longer relevant due to rapidly changing technologies. The reviewer advises others to consider a different path if they want to learn backend development."
"As a software professional on the embedded side that has wanting to make a jump to the web side, this is EXACTLY what I was looking for. With that being said, it starts off at a perfect pace for a beginner as well, with plenty of challenges along the way to test and refine knowledge as it's gained instead of hurrying off to the next topic.","The customer found this course to be exactly what they were looking for to transition from embedded software to web development, starting at a perfect pace for beginners with gradual challenges to learn and refine their skills."
"I recommend to take 100 days of code using Python then proceed to this bootcamp. Python will give you better understanding because of lesser code than Javascript. and also they have some same videos for basic HTML and some code, which is really good to think without looking at the solution. you can also see the difference when using else if statement.","This reviewer praises the 100-day coding course in Python, stating that it provides a strong foundation before moving on to other topics like JavaScript. They appreciate the bootcamp's video content, including basic HTML and code explanations that encourage self-study and hands-on practice."
"Really good course, you need to dig in on some documentation because the outdated data, but this helps to improve your skills on reading the documentation the proper way. 100% recommended.","The reviewer found the course to be excellent, highlighting a key takeaway that the updated documentation is crucial for improving one's skills in extracting valuable information from it. They wholeheartedly recommend the course."
"Not only is a very complete course, the way is explanined is so fun, didactic and detailed. No extra music on the background, a pleasant voice pitch and the diction of the teacher is just perfect.","This user thoroughly enjoyed the online course they took, praising its completeness, engaging teaching style, and high-quality production values, including clear audio and pleasant narration. Overall, the experience was found to be both fun and informative."
Angela has so much enthusiasm and it comes across in everything she says. Content is very interesting and informative - need to move on to the next lesson as soon as the last one has finished.,"Angela was highly enthusiastic and knowledgeable, delivering engaging lessons that were both informative and enjoyable. She effectively conveyed her passion for the subject, making it a compelling experience."
It's a very comprehensive course in terms of the topics covered. But I think the quality of the javascript section in this course is not upto the mark. There are lots of think which are important but are not covered eg. Promise API.,"The reviewer found the course to be comprehensive, covering a range of topics, but was underwhelmed by its JavaScript section, feeling that some key concepts were not adequately covered."
"The course has complicated topics in it, a few classes might be confusing, but overall Dr Angela explains things in a clear, concise manner, and she's always pushing people to keep going by the end of each module. Thoroughly recommend it.","The customer found the course to have complex material, but was helped navigate its challenges through Dr. Angela's clear explanations. The instructor's encouragement made a big difference in their success with the course."

I highly recommend this course to new beginners.","The customer found the course to be worth their investment and appreciated Angela's in-depth explanations of key programming concepts, particularly those related to APIs.

Because it's very help full for me. When I start this course I just know about the HTML and CSS but letter on I got to much from this course. And it helps me to be the one in my life.

And I give four star because of one or two module are not completely update.,"The customer found the course to be very helpful, expanding their knowledge from HTML and CSS to a wide range of topics, and feeling empowered enough to take on new challenges in their web career. Despite giving it 4 stars, they mentioned that some modules were outdated."
"Awesome course! Everything is expressed an explained straight to the point. I come from learning how to code from books which gives a deeper understanding, I wish that I started out with her videos to save time. I moved from books to this course for the exercises, quizzes and projects to make sure that I utilize, practice, and retain the material.","The reviewer found the course to be straightforward and effective, stating it helped them grasp coding concepts quickly and efficiently compared to learning from books. They wished they had started with the videos instead of books, as it would have saved time."
After completing this course I feel confident. After lots of ups and down finally I completed this course. Thanks to you for this wonderful course and I hope that you always brings new things.

great course for intermediate programmers but not for beginner i guess cause some topics of advancejava script has OOPS concept that means the person who didnt know programming language before would not understand.,"This reviewer found a course suitable for intermediate programmers, but notes that it may be too advanced for beginners due to its focus on OOPS concepts in Advanced Java Script."

I recommend this course!","Customer found the course to be well-structured, comprehensive, and interactive, making it highly effective in teaching its material. They wholeheartedly endorse the course, recommending it to others due to its usefulness."
"It's definitely challenging, but I'm able to understand and continue with the modules. I can't know for sure if I'll be able to successfully become a software engineer, but if I don't, it will be on me because the Instructor is teaching good, giving many examples and exercises. So far I'm happy with this course.","The customer found the course challenging but appreciated the instructor's guidance and resources, which helped them understand and continue with the modules. They are satisfied with the course so far, despite acknowledging that becoming a software engineer is a difficult goal to achieve."
"Course is great and all explanations are clear. But there are several missed concepts. The React section don't cover everything like Router, useEffect and others. Even if they covered in Web3 section I think it would be better if it will be on React section too. In my opinion after this course not everyone will start carrer on Web3. It would be better if there are more big projects like building NFT Marketplace but combining React, PostgreSQL and NodeJS together. Some courses should be updated too but it is not big problem.","The customer found the course to be clear in explanations, but felt that some concepts were missing or glossed over, particularly those related to React. Overall, they thought the course was good but suggested improvements and more comprehensive projects to enhance its value."
outdated mongodb section and overall outdate course.you can still use this as a guide by reading new documentation for the respective tech and looking at new comments can help you find solution,"The customer found the MongoDB section to be outdated, but still usable with modern documentation. The reviewer suggests supplementing with newer resources to overcome limitations."
"I really loved this course. Angela's teaching style is very engaging, and it feels as though she is speaking directly to you at times.

The course provided a great balance of learning and practice, leaving them wanting more courses from the same instructor."
"The only thing i didn't like was that when i was doing this course all my technology versions were way ahead of what were used in this course and this lead to many many issues and problem. Even to some point that I had to leave that section and move forward. The most problematic sections were the website deploy, the crypto and the NFT ones.","The customer found the course frustrating due to technology versions being outdated, leading to numerous problems with specific sections such as website deployment, cryptocurrency, and NFT topics. This made it so they had to leave certain parts of the course."
"Angela, you are so sweet and kind, but I was expecting a beginner friendly course. I hate the fact that we don't code along with you and I hate the fact that you expect us to solve an exercise before you showing us how to do it. It's like you expect a child to eat by himself, but he never was taught how...","The customer felt misled about the course being beginner-friendly and expressed frustration with the instructor's approach, which they found too independent and confusing."
"It was really fun learning to be a web developer but I had a lot of problems, sometimes I didn't understand the programming logic and sometimes I felt frustrated because my program didn't work. So I really repeated a lot of explanations so it could be said that my progress was not that fast. However, I felt this was the challenge and I continued to progress and learn until I became a junior web developer in the future.","The reviewer enjoyed learning web development but faced challenges with understanding programming logic and frequent frustrations, slowing their progress. Despite setbacks, they persisted and eventually achieved junior web developer status."

However, my experience took a nosedive once I reached Section 33, which focused on MongoDB.","This customer initially had a good experience with Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp but became dissatisfied after hitting a roadblock in Section 33, focusing on MongoDB, which they found lacking compared to the previous sections."
"Angela Yu's full-stack web development course has its pros and cons. The HTML and CSS sections stand out for their clear explanations and thorough content coverage. However, the JavaScript portion, particularly the function section, falls short. Understanding how to return values can be challenging, and the examples provided may not always be helpful or relevant, leading to confusion instead of clarity.","Angela Yu's full-stack web development course has both strong and weak points; the HTML and CSS sections are well-explained and comprehensive, but the JavaScript portion is lacking, with unclear explanations and confusing examples."
"The best web development online bootcamp money can get, the instructor is great and friendly, the course is engaging overall I am so happy that I took this course. Thank you, Dr. Angela Yu and Greetings from Egypt, :).","The reviewer highly recommends Dr. Angela Yu's web development online bootcamp, praising its engaging content and exceptional instructor. They express their gratitude for taking the course and leave a positive message of appreciation."
"This is the worst course I have ever taken in my entire life. The videos are very old, there are no resources, some resources don't work anymore, and the websites it recommends no longer exist. As you watch videos, the instructor removes them randomly, and the videos are all messed up. This course is a total waste of time. There are so many better courses available for free.","The customer was extremely dissatisfied with this online course, citing outdated video content, broken resources, and poor technical issues that made it nearly impossible to complete. They considered the course a total waste of time and recommended looking into free alternatives."
"I am absolutely thrilled with this course!

Will definitely come back and review.","The reviewer is extremely satisfied with the course, praising its comprehensive coverage of web development topics and engaging teaching style."
