review,summary
HTML and CSS if very nicely covered but later sections are recorded more than 4 years back and now each and everything has updated so much that it became a pathetic experience to follow this course. This course should be updated totally or should not be named as web development bootcamp 2023?,"The course content is outdated, making it a poor learning experience due to recent updates in HTML and CSS standards. It should either undergo significant updates or be renamed to avoid misleading expectations regarding current technology advancements."
"Initially, I rated this course 5 stars and EVERYTHING was indeed 5 stars till authentication module where everythig was outdated and I thought it's just Authentication module and that's it BUT then React module came after where everything is so outdated that you cannot do a single thing from video without getting an error that says that way of doing it is outdated and no longer supported. I remember from Angela video that she once said that we should rethink twice before buying an outdated udemy course..Huge dissapointment at the end because I could not get a single full project from this course without not watching 8+ hours youtube tutorials to cover the holes from this course...","Overdramatic critique highlighting major issues with outdated content and requiring extensive supplementary learning, leading to significant disappointment."
"Best course ever for web development. No one can match the level of her efforts that she put in making this course. After completion of this course , you will be capable for freelancing. She taught the front end and back end very well. The best thing about this course is that she keep updating the course time to time.","An outstanding web development course with comprehensive teaching on both frontend and backend, highly effective and regularly updated by the instructor, preparing students for potential freelancing opportunities."
"The course is good ! BUT I think when teaching everything together is best than separate topics , example creating projects that uses all tecnologies in one project its hard to get on beginning but good to have every thing in a same project , a project like Social Network would be great , I dont know if it exists in the next lessons , but so far has been good , Thanks",Appreciates integrated course projects over separate topics but finds creating such projects challenging; overall pleased with content thus far; awaits future social network project integration.
"just a average course, she just ask you to read other documentation for even basic concepts and because other documentation aren't for beginners, you need external sources like other youtube channels to understand. there is room for lots of improvement in the course.","The course lacks beginner-friendly documentation and relies heavily on external resources, indicating significant areas for improvement."
"I completed a web development bootcamp and it was an amazing experience. The instructors were knowledgeable, the curriculum was well-structured. Highly recommend it to anyone looking to get into web development.",Enrolled in a highly informative web development bootcamp with knowledgeable instructors and well-structured curriculum; strongly recommends for aspiring developers.
"This course is best for beginners who want to know the basics of web designing. It may not have some advanced topics that are not necessary for understanding basics. My only suggestion is certification is only provided for completed full courses, I requested the Author provide different types of certificates for front-end, back-end and full-stack. It will also help to attract more students, that's my humble request thankyou.","A beginner-friendly course focusing on web designing basics, though it lacks advanced topics. Suggesting multiple certification options for front-end, back-end, and full-stack to attract more students and fulfill their needs more comprehensively."
"This course has been amazing for me to learn the fundamentals and I think it has been designed in a way for us to get stuck , read a few doc , try to figure it out and move on . Great Job !!","The course effectively presents foundational material with challenges that encourage independent learning through reading and problem-solving, showcasing excellent design and quality."
Angela has been helping me to get to my educational goals. Having a outstanding teacher has helped me be successful in all of my current projects in her corse. I really love how easy she has made accessing further help on every project & I can go on my own time.,"Angela is an outstanding teacher who helps me achieve my educational goals, making the learning process easy and accessible for self-paced projects."
"This is the third course I have taken from Angela and it's as always highly interesting and project-oriented, if you want to gain leadership in the web realm just take the course and work hard. It's worth the money.","Angela's courses are consistently engaging and project-focused, providing valuable insights for web leadership; customers find them worthwhile in terms of both content and cost."
"before taking this course i was a studying coding just by finding long hours YouTube videos and others. but this course was a hidden Jem for me now i found it. it is concise and to the point above all it is time saver. thank you, Angela, for making this course, wish you best of luck in your endeavors!!!","Angela's online coding course proved invaluable for a beginner like me who relied on YouTube tutorials, offering concise and efficient learning that saved me time. Her dedication is greatly appreciated."
Angela's course is great and is fun to follow along. I can't provide a perfect score simply because some of the more important parts on the backend segment are outdated. Though I guess some would argue that the struggle to figure out the proper solution is part of the learning process. (It was stressful nonetheless),"Angela's course is enjoyable and helpful, though some backend content feels outdated. The challenge in solving problems adds to the learning experience, although it can be stressful."
I am a manager working to refresh my knowledge and get back into hands-on development. This course has been amazing in how it is structured and how it guides me through concepts. This is what I needed and more.,"The course offers an excellent, structured learning experience perfect for managers seeking to update their skills in on-the-ground development, exceeding expectations with its comprehensive approach."
"Pretty easy to understand they the teacher explains everything, even if you are a complete beginner, this is all you need to go from basic to intermediate, then, of course, you need to figure out how to become a better programmer.","The course is well-explained, suitable for beginners and covers the essentials from basic to intermediate level, with additional focus on improving programming skills."
"She is an amazing teacher! Angela's teaching is outstanding. It's easy to understand, her pronunciation is clear, and even though English isn't my native language, I can follow along easily. Her valuable tips and motivational words are a great help for my learning. I highly recommend her lectures.","Angela's teaching is outstanding, easy to understand, clearly pronounced, and motivating, making the course accessible even if English isn't one's native language."
"For this price, it is an amazing course. It covers a wide range of programming knowledge, including GIT, CSS, JS, Node, DB, API, React, JQuery,  Web 3 and etc. The React section is a bit outdated, but the explanations are perfect! I have access to the Laracast platform, and I can make comparisons. In my opinion, Angela has created good practices and provided valuable resources for developers. It's a good starting point. However, I need new knowledge about the latest React 18 and a deeper dive into hooks, etc.","A comprehensive course covering various programming skills at an affordable price; helpful with its resources and coverage, though lacking in the latest React 18 content and in-depth hook exploration."
"There is a big mismatch and midway updates in some of the course contents . Meanwhile you replaced the section of Mongoose DB with a new section for Postgres DB,  the subsequent sections are talking heavily about the usage of Mongoose. Not Only that but Mongoose is kept as a main part of code structure in Authentication and Security Section and left us suffering either skip this part or searching for proper solutions.","Customer feedback highlights issues with inconsistent updates, missing sections, and problematic integration of Mongoose DB over Postgres DB, particularly affecting the Authentication and Security section."
"She is very good at creating the course, but at this point of time (sept 2023) i am unable to follow her videos as she just went and deleted obsolete videos and didnt warn or do anything then she post a seperate link for old video, but after deleting the videos she didt post the new video in their place, there are few new videos , but you cant understand them if havenot studied the old videos , so basically if you wish to follow this couse you need to first study old course the start new couse , so basically this new course is forcefully inserted , angela you should have posted a new course with updated video and just sell it at a lowest price","Angela should have updated her course with new content and sold it at a reduced price. The deletion of old videos disrupts the learning flow, requiring students to revisit older material before engaging with new content."
"Very very well structured, and the best thing to me in this course is it's not about only learning web development from scratch and knowing the industry used jargons and best practices, but this course also teaches you to learn almost anything and many other useful stuffs. Lots of love for the instructor Dr. Angela Yu.","This online course is highly structured and goes beyond web development basics, teaching transferable skills and featuring engaging content from instructor Dr. Angela Yu."
"I started this course a month ago. I found this interesting till the end of frontend module. As of now the backend modules are completely outdated. The frontend section is amazing as it's up to date. but the backend lectures are from 2018 and the technologies are changed. So, I request to check the course backend section at the time of your purchase. Again, if you want to become a frontend developer you can go for it. Please update the course as soon as possible.","The course is up-to-date with fantastic frontend content but outdated backend modules from 2018, lacking relevance in current technologies. Frontend learners can still benefit; however, a course update is requested for the backend section to align with current industry standards."
"As a software professional on the embedded side that has wanting to make a jump to the web side, this is EXACTLY what I was looking for. With that being said, it starts off at a perfect pace for a beginner as well, with plenty of challenges along the way to test and refine knowledge as it's gained instead of hurrying off to the next topic.","This web-side software course is ideal for beginners, offering a gradual pace with challenging exercises to reinforce learning. It successfully transitions embedded software professionals into web development, making it an excellent choice for those eager to advance in their careers."
"I recommend to take 100 days of code using Python then proceed to this bootcamp. Python will give you better understanding because of lesser code than Javascript. and also they have some same videos for basic HTML and some code, which is really good to think without looking at the solution. you can also see the difference when using else if statement.","This bootcamp complements a Python course and offers valuable insights through shared videos with basic HTML, enhancing problem-solving skills via conditional statements."
"Really good course, you need to dig in on some documentation because the outdated data, but this helps to improve your skills on reading the documentation the proper way. 100% recommended.","A highly recommended online course offering valuable skills through detailed documentation study, despite occasional outdated information."
"Not only is a very complete course, the way is explanined is so fun, didactic and detailed. No extra music on the background, a pleasant voice pitch and the diction of the teacher is just perfect.","The customer praises the comprehensive, enjoyable, and well-explained course with a pleasant audio experience, making it both informative and relaxing."
Angela has so much enthusiasm and it comes across in everything she says. Content is very interesting and informative - need to move on to the next lesson as soon as the last one has finished.,"Angela's enthusiastic delivery and engaging content make the course enjoyable, with a strong desire for continuous learning after each session."
It's a very comprehensive course in terms of the topics covered. But I think the quality of the javascript section in this course is not upto the mark. There are lots of think which are important but are not covered eg. Promise API.,"The course offers comprehensive content, yet its JavaScript section falls short by omitting crucial topics like the Promise API."
"The course has complicated topics in it, a few classes might be confusing, but overall Dr Angela explains things in a clear, concise manner, and she's always pushing people to keep going by the end of each module. Thoroughly recommend it.","Comprehensive course with challenging topics expertly explained by Dr. Angela, pushing learners through each module with engaging pacing. Highly recommended."

It serves as an excellent introduction to the vast world of web development. Admittedly, the course content is somewhat outdated, necessitating the use of additional resources. Nevertheless, considering its price, this course is an absolute gem. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Angela for her mentorship and the impressive way she delivers her lessons.","This online web development course by Angela Yu is highly recommended for beginners, offering valuable insights into learning and applying knowledge in web development. Despite some outdated content that requires supplementary resources, its affordability and effective delivery make it an invaluable introduction to the field."
"It's definitely worth it to buy this course. Specially i was struggling one of the important topics in programming API that Angela deep dive into this field.

I highly recommend this course to new beginners.","The course offers comprehensive programming API insights taught by Angela, engaging and motivating, suitable for new beginners."
Because it's very help full for me. When I start this course I just know about the HTML and CSS but letter on I got to much from this course. And it helps me to be the one in my life. I just start but now I can do much more in my Web career. And I give four star because of one or two module are not completely update.,"The course is highly helpful, providing a comprehensive understanding of HTML and CSS beyond basics, leading to increased confidence in web career, though some modules aren't fully up-to-date, resulting in a four-star rating."
"Awesome course! Everything is expressed an explained straight to the point. I come from learning how to code from books which gives a deeper understanding, I wish that I started out with her videos to save time. I moved from books to this course for the exercises, quizzes and projects to make sure that I utilize, practice, and retain the material.","A comprehensive online course, praised for its clear explanations and effective hands-on practice through exercises, quizzes, and projects, making it a valuable alternative to traditional book learning, especially for those new to coding."

Thank you, Angela and her team, for making my dream to become a developer possible! <3",Angela's engaging teaching style and realistic projects make the course an excellent pathway to becoming a developer.
"Everything is awesome, but as a mobile user I'm unable to do coding exercises, if there is anything that mobile users install and do coding exercises, please do mention it,it will help a lot.","Great course overall, though lacking mobile-specific coding exercises for practice, would greatly enhance user experience."
great course for intermediate programmers but not for beginner i guess cause some topics of advancejava script has OOPS concept that means the person who didnt know programming language before would not understand.,The course is excellent for intermediate programmers but may be challenging for beginners due to advanced Java Script concepts involving Object-Oriented Programming.
"An impressive course! It is very well structured, concise and very useful due to the practical part that requires the student's involvement in creating applications. I recommend this course!","This online course offers a well-structured, concise, and practically engaging experience with applications, making it highly recommended for learners."
"It's definitely challenging, but I'm able to understand and continue with the modules. I can't know for sure if I'll be able to successfully become a software engineer, but if I don't, it will be on me because the Instructor is teaching good, giving many examples and exercises. So far I'm happy with this course.","The course offers a rigorous challenge that enables understanding and progression through modules, supported by insightful instruction and practical examples; overall satisfaction is noted."
"Course is great and all explanations are clear. But there are several missed concepts. The React section don't cover everything like Router, useEffect and others. Even if they covered in Web3 section I think it would be better if it will be on React section too. In my opinion after this course not everyone will start carrer on Web3. It would be better if there are more big projects like building NFT Marketplace but combining React, PostgreSQL and NodeJS together. Some courses should be updated too but it is not big problem.","The course provides clear explanations but lacks coverage of essential concepts like Router and useEffect in the React section, potentially limiting career prospects in Web3. Suggestions for more comprehensive projects and course updates are recommended to enhance value."
outdated mongodb section and overall outdate course.you can still use this as a guide by reading new documentation for the respective tech and looking at new comments can help you find solution,"The course has an outdated MongoDB section and is generally old, but it serves as a foundational guide; refer to updated docs and community feedback for improvements."
"I really loved this course. Angela's teaching style is very engaging, and it feels as though she is speaking directly to you at times. She explains the concepts very well and provides challenges along the way to practice what you've just learned. I very much enjoyed this course, and I hope that she teaches courses on other development technologies soon.","This course is highly engaging with Angela's direct teaching style and clear explanations, complemented by practical challenges. It offers a valuable learning experience across various development technologies."
"The only thing i didn't like was that when i was doing this course all my technology versions were way ahead of what were used in this course and this lead to many many issues and problem. Even to some point that I had to leave that section and move forward. The most problematic sections were the website deploy, the crypto and the NFT ones.","The customer appreciates the course but notes frustration with outdated technology, particularly impacting sections on website deployment, crypto, and NFTs, requiring them to advance in the course. These issues hindered their learning experience and forced progression. Overall, while satisfied with most content, they highlight the need for updated tech references. Enhancements could improve alignment between course material and practical skills, addressing technological discrepancies and streamlining learning experiences. The customer expresses gratitude for the opportunity despite facing technical obstacles, suggesting improvements to better match course content with contemporary technology standards."
"Angela, you are so sweet and kind, but I was expecting a beginner friendly course. I hate the fact that we don't code along with you and I hate the fact that you expect us to solve an exercise before you showing us how to do it. It's like you expect a child to eat by himself, but he never was taught how...","Angela offers a beginner-friendly course, yet lacks coding integration and requires problem-solving before instruction, akin to expecting a child to learn independently without guidance."
"It was really fun learning to be a web developer but I had a lot of problems, sometimes I didn't understand the programming logic and sometimes I felt frustrated because my program didn't work. So I really repeated a lot of explanations so it could be said that my progress was not that fast. However, I felt this was the challenge and I continued to progress and learn until I became a junior web developer in the future.","The course offered valuable insights into web development but came with challenges, including understanding complex programming logic and troubleshooting issues. Despite these obstacles, the experience served as motivation for continued learning and eventual advancement to a junior web developer level."
"I recently completed Angela's course, and I must say it was an outstanding experience. The course was incredibly engaging and entertaining throughout. Angela's teaching style is not only informative but also very enjoyable.","Angela's online course was highly engaging and entertaining, with a great teaching style that made learning both informative and enjoyable."
"I enrolled in Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp 2023 with high hopes after completing the initial 32 sections, which were relatively up to date and well-structured. However, my experience took a nosedive once I reached Section 33, which focused on MongoDB.","Enrolled in Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp 2023, initially satisfied with the first 32 sections, but found Section 33 on MongoDB to be of poor quality and lacking substance."
"Angela Yu's full-stack web development course has its pros and cons. The HTML and CSS sections stand out for their clear explanations and thorough content coverage. However, the JavaScript portion, particularly the function section, falls short. Understanding how to return values can be challenging, and the examples provided may not always be helpful or relevant, leading to confusion instead of clarity.","Angela Yu's full-stack web development course offers clear HTML and CSS content but struggles with JavaScript, specifically in explaining how functions return values, which is confusing for learners."
"The best web development online bootcamp money can get, the instructor is great and friendly, the course is engaging overall I am so happy that I took this course. Thank you, Dr. Angela Yu and Greetings from Egypt, :).","Comprehensive web development course with a friendly instructor, engaging content, and high value for money, highly satisfied with the program thanks to Dr. Angela Yu and greetings from Egypt; excellent choice for developers seeking top-tier skills. Gratitude expressed to both Dr. Angela Yu and Egypt as sources of positivity and learning enhancement."
"This is the worst course I have ever taken in my entire life. The videos are very old, there are no resources, some resources don't work anymore, and the websites it recommends no longer exist. As you watch videos, the instructor removes them randomly, and the videos are all messed up. This course is a total waste of time. There are so many better courses available for free.","A highly dissatisfied customer describes an outdated, broken, and unreliable online course with no support or resources, deemed a poor use of their time compared to more valuable alternatives."
"I am absolutely thrilled with this course! The course covers a wide range of web development topics, providing a comprehensive and up-to-date curriculum and Dr Angelas Yus teaching style really encourages you to push forward. Will definitely come back and review.",Enthusiastic Review: Comprehensive Curriculum and Engaging Teaching Style Enhance Learning Experience; Plans to Return for More Content.
