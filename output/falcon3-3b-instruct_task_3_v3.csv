review,summary
HTML and CSS if very nicely covered but later sections are recorded more than 4 years back and now each and everything has updated so much that it became a pathetic experience to follow this course. This course should be updated totally or should not be named as web development bootcamp 2023?,"Customer feels the course content is outdated due to lack of recent updates, suggesting an urgent need for complete revision or reconsideration of course branding."
"Initially, I rated this course 5 stars and EVERYTHING was indeed 5 stars till authentication module where everythig was outdated and I thought it's just Authentication module and that's it BUT then React module came after where everything is so outdated that you cannot do a single thing from video without getting an error that says that way of doing it is outdated and no longer supported. I remember from Angela video that she once said that we should rethink twice before buying an outdated udemy course..Huge dissapointment at the end because I could not get a single full project from this course without not watching 8+ hours youtube tutorials to cover the holes from this course...","Had a 5-star expectation but encountered outdated content and modules, leading to significant frustration and the need for extensive external tutorials to complete projects. Disappointment high due to course's limitations and Angela's warning on purchasing outdated Udemy courses."
"Best course ever for web development. No one can match the level of her efforts that she put in making this course. After completion of this course , you will be capable for freelancing. She taught the front end and back end very well. The best thing about this course is that she keep updating the course time to time.","An outstanding web development course led by dedicated instructors who provide comprehensive content, including regular updates, teaching both frontend and backend skills effectively, ideal for aspiring freelancers."
"The course is good ! BUT I think when teaching everything together is best than separate topics , example creating projects that uses all tecnologies in one project its hard to get on beginning but good to have every thing in a same project , a project like Social Network would be great , I dont know if it exists in the next lessons , but so far has been good , Thanks","The course is overall positive, with a preference for integrated projects using multiple technologies, such as building a social network. However, finding comprehensive resources for these projects remains challenging. So far, it's been quite informative, thanks for the effort."
"just a average course, she just ask you to read other documentation for even basic concepts and because other documentation aren't for beginners, you need external sources like other youtube channels to understand. there is room for lots of improvement in the course.","The course lacks beginner-friendly documentation and relies heavily on external resources, indicating significant areas for improvement."
"I completed a web development bootcamp and it was an amazing experience. The instructors were knowledgeable, the curriculum was well-structured. Highly recommend it to anyone looking to get into web development.",A highly knowledgeable and well-structured web development bootcamp that is strongly recommended for those entering the field.
"This course is best for beginners who want to know the basics of web designing. It may not have some advanced topics that are not necessary for understanding basics. My only suggestion is certification is only provided for completed full courses, I requested the Author provide different types of certificates for front-end, back-end and full-stack. It will also help to attract more students, that's my humble request thankyou.","An excellent introduction to web designing for beginners, though it lacks advanced topics and offers only a single certification type. Requesting diverse certificates could boost enrollment and appeal to a wider audience. Thank you for this course."
"This course has been amazing for me to learn the fundamentals and I think it has been designed in a way for us to get stuck , read a few doc , try to figure it out and move on . Great Job !!","The course effectively teaches fundamentals with challenges, encouraging self-learning through reading and problem-solving, praised highly by the reviewer."

It's worth the money.","The customer appreciates Angela's courses for their interest and project focus, valuing them as a strong investment in learning web leadership skills."
"before taking this course i was a studying coding just by finding long hours YouTube videos and others. but this course was a hidden Jem for me now i found it. it is concise and to the point above all it is time saver. thank you, Angela, for making this course, wish you best of luck in your endeavors!!!","The course provided a valuable, concise, and efficient learning experience, significantly improving Angela's coding skills. She greatly appreciates the instructor's effort and is looking forward to future endeavors."
Angela's course is great and is fun to follow along. I can't provide a perfect score simply because some of the more important parts on the backend segment are outdated. Though I guess some would argue that the struggle to figure out the proper solution is part of the learning process. (It was stressful nonetheless),"Angela's course offers engaging content, though some aspects are outdated, which may add to the learning challenge and stress level."
I am a manager working to refresh my knowledge and get back into hands-on development. This course has been amazing in how it is structured and how it guides me through concepts. This is what I needed and more.,"This course provides a refreshing, well-structured learning experience with practical applications, perfectly suited for a manager looking to enhance their development skills."
"Pretty easy to understand they the teacher explains everything, even if you are a complete beginner, this is all you need to go from basic to intermediate, then, of course, you need to figure out how to become a better programmer.","The course is well-structured and easy to follow, providing comprehensive guidance from basics to advanced programming skills."
"She is an amazing teacher! Angela's teaching is outstanding. It's easy to understand, her pronunciation is clear, and even though English isn't my native language, I can follow along easily. Her valuable tips and motivational words are a great help for my learning. I highly recommend her lectures.","Angela's teaching is outstanding, easy to understand, clear, and beneficial with valuable insights and motivational words, making the course highly recommended."
"For this price, it is an amazing course. It covers a wide range of programming knowledge, including GIT, CSS, JS, Node, DB, API, React, JQuery,  Web 3 and etc. The React section is a bit outdated, but the explanations are perfect! I have access to the Laracast platform, and I can make comparisons. In my opinion, Angela has created good practices and provided valuable resources for developers. It's a good starting point. However, I need new knowledge about the latest React 18 and a deeper dive into hooks, etc.","Angela delivers comprehensive coverage of essential programming skills, serving as a solid foundation but noting outdated React 18 content and a desire for advanced topics like modern React features and hooks."
"There is a big mismatch and midway updates in some of the course contents . Meanwhile you replaced the section of Mongoose DB with a new section for Postgres DB,  the subsequent sections are talking heavily about the usage of Mongoose. Not Only that but Mongoose is kept as a main part of code structure in Authentication and Security Section and left us suffering either skip this part or searching for proper solutions.","Customer feedback highlights discrepancies in course content updates, particularly concerning the switch from Mongoose DB to Postgres DB, which affects content on authentication and security sections relying heavily on Mongoose."
"She is very good at creating the course, but at this point of time (sept 2023) i am unable to follow her videos as she just went and deleted obsolete videos and didnt warn or do anything then she post a seperate link for old video, but after deleting the videos she didt post the new video in their place, there are few new videos , but you cant understand them if havenot studied the old videos , so basically if you wish to follow this couse you need to first study old course the start new couse , so basically this new course is forcefully inserted , angela you should have posted a new course with updated video and just sell it at a lowest price","Customer appreciates Angela's initial course creation but finds recent videos disconnected without old course content, urging for an updated, unified, and affordable course to resume learning progress."
"Very very well structured, and the best thing to me in this course is it's not about only learning web development from scratch and knowing the industry used jargons and best practices, but this course also teaches you to learn almost anything and many other useful stuffs. Lots of love for the instructor Dr. Angela Yu.","The course is well-structured and offers comprehensive web development knowledge along with broader learning skills. Highly appreciated by both the content and instructor, Dr. Angela Yu."
"I started this course a month ago. I found this interesting till the end of frontend module. As of now the backend modules are completely outdated. The frontend section is amazing as it's up to date. but the backend lectures are from 2018 and the technologies are changed. So, I request to check the course backend section at the time of your purchase. Again, if you want to become a frontend developer you can go for it. Please update the course as soon as possible.","The customer finds the frontend modules engaging but outdated due to discrepancies with current backend technologies, prompting an urgent request for updates to enhance the learning experience, especially relevant for aspiring frontend developers."
"As a software professional on the embedded side that has wanting to make a jump to the web side, this is EXACTLY what I was looking for. With that being said, it starts off at a perfect pace for a beginner as well, with plenty of challenges along the way to test and refine knowledge as it's gained instead of hurrying off to the next topic.","A highly recommended course for software professionals transitioning from embedded to web development, offering an ideal blend of ease and progressive challenges."
"I recommend to take 100 days of code using Python then proceed to this bootcamp. Python will give you better understanding because of lesser code than Javascript. and also they have some same videos for basic HTML and some code, which is really good to think without looking at the solution. you can also see the difference when using else if statement.","This bootcamp complements a 100-day Python course, offering advanced topics in JavaScript and valuable lessons on conditional statements like `else if`, enhancing practical coding skills through interactive videos."
"Really good course, you need to dig in on some documentation because the outdated data, but this helps to improve your skills on reading the documentation the proper way. 100% recommended.","An excellent course with valuable insights despite outdated documentation, enhancing readers' ability to interpret it effectively. Highly recommended."
"Not only is a very complete course, the way is explanined is so fun, didactic and detailed. No extra music on the background, a pleasant voice pitch and the diction of the teacher is just perfect.","A highly comprehensive and engaging course with an enjoyable teaching style, devoid of distracting background music, providing a smooth learning experience."

Content is very interesting and informative - need to move on to the next lesson as soon as the last one has finished.,"Angela's enthusiastic delivery and engaging content make the course highly enjoyable, prompting a swift transition to the next lesson after each one ends."
It's a very comprehensive course in terms of the topics covered. But I think the quality of the javascript section in this course is not upto the mark. There are lots of think which are important but are not covered eg. Promise API.,"The course offers comprehensive content, particularly strong in HTML/CSS, but lacks depth in JavaScript, notably missing topics like Promise API."
"The course has complicated topics in it, a few classes might be confusing, but overall Dr Angela explains things in a clear, concise manner, and she's always pushing people to keep going by the end of each module.

I highly recommend this course to new beginners.","Angela covers programming APIs comprehensively, engagingly teaching both frontend and backend topics. Her clear subtitles and motivational ads make it an excellent choice for new programmers, recommended by the reviewer."
Because it's very help full for me. When I start this course I just know about the HTML and CSS but letter on I got to much from this course. And it helps me to be the one in my life. I just start but now I can do much more in my Web career. And I give four star because of one or two module are not completely update.,"The customer found the online course very helpful, enhancing their knowledge from HTML/CSS to becoming a more proficient web developer, despite some modules needing updates for full currency."

"Everything is awesome, but as a mobile user I'm unable to do coding exercises, if there is anything that mobile users install and do coding exercises, please do mention it,it will help a lot.","Excellent course overall, though lacking mobile-specific coding resources which would enhance the experience for mobile learners."
great course for intermediate programmers but not for beginner i guess cause some topics of advancejava script has OOPS concept that means the person who didnt know programming language before would not understand.,"Good for intermediates, assumes prior knowledge; confusing advanced Java concepts for beginners."

"It's definitely challenging, but I'm able to understand and continue with the modules. I can't know for sure if I'll be able to successfully become a software engineer, but if I don't, it will be on me because the Instructor is teaching good, giving many examples and exercises. So far I'm happy with this course.","The course offers valuable insights and challenging content, supported by a helpful instructor who provides ample examples and exercises. Overall, it's satisfying so far, though success as a software engineer is uncertain due to the current focus on fundamental skills rather than industry readiness."
"Course is great and all explanations are clear. But there are several missed concepts. The React section don't cover everything like Router, useEffect and others. Even if they covered in Web3 section I think it would be better if it will be on React section too. In my opinion after this course not everyone will start carrer on Web3. It would be better if there are more big projects like building NFT Marketplace but combining React, PostgreSQL and NodeJS together. Some courses should be updated too but it is not big problem.","The online course provides clear explanations but misses crucial concepts like Router and useEffect in the React section, potentially steering students away from web3 careers. It could benefit from integrating more large-scale projects and updates to improve relevance and comprehensiveness."
outdated mongodb section and overall outdate course.you can still use this as a guide by reading new documentation for the respective tech and looking at new comments can help you find solution,"The course is outdated, particularly in the MongoDB section, but it serves as a basic guide; users are advised to consult new documentation and community feedback for updated solutions. Still valuable for foundational understanding. "
"I really loved this course. Angela's teaching style is very engaging, and it feels as though she is speaking directly to you at times.

I very much enjoyed this course, and I hope that she teaches courses on other development technologies soon.","Enthralling course by Angela taught with engaging style, clear explanations, and practical challenges; looking forward to more technology-focused courses from her."
"The only thing i didn't like was that when i was doing this course all my technology versions were way ahead of what were used in this course and this lead to many many issues and problem. Even to some point that I had to leave that section and move forward. The most problematic sections were the website deploy, the crypto and the NFT ones.","The customer appreciated the course but was frustrated by outdated technology, particularly affecting sections like website deployment, crypto, and NFTs, which they found problematic and disruptive to their learning experience."
"Angela, you are so sweet and kind, but I was expecting a beginner friendly course. I hate the fact that we don't code along with you and I hate the fact that you expect us to solve an exercise before you showing us how to do it. It's like you expect a child to eat by himself, but he never was taught how...","The course offered by Angela is praised for its kindness but criticized for being too advanced and lacking guidance in the learning process, making it difficult for beginners without proper instruction beforehand."
"It was really fun learning to be a web developer but I had a lot of problems, sometimes I didn't understand the programming logic and sometimes I felt frustrated because my program didn't work.

However, my experience took a nosedive once I reached Section 33, which focused on MongoDB.",Enrolled in Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp 2023 with hopes for the course but experienced a decline after reaching MongoDB-focused Section 33.
"Angela Yu's full-stack web development course has its pros and cons. The HTML and CSS sections stand out for their clear explanations and thorough content coverage.

Understanding how to return values can be challenging, and the examples provided may not always be helpful or relevant, leading to confusion instead of clarity.","Angela Yu's web development course offers excellent HTML/CSS with thorough content but struggles with JavaScript functions, making some explanations confusing rather than clarifying how to return values effectively."

"This is the worst course I have ever taken in my entire life. The videos are very old, there are no resources, some resources don't work anymore, and the websites it recommends no longer exist. As you watch videos, the instructor removes them randomly, and the videos are all messed up. This course is a total waste of time. There are so many better courses available for free.","The course is outdated with non-functional resources and poor video quality, offering no value compared to free alternatives available."
