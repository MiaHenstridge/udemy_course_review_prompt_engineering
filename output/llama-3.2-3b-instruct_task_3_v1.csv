review,summary
HTML and CSS if very nicely covered but later sections are recorded more than 4 years back and now each and everything has updated so much that it became a pathetic experience to follow this course. This course should be updated totally or should not be named as web development bootcamp 2023?,"The reviewer found the HTML and CSS sections of the course up-to-date, but subsequent topics were outdated by over four years, rendering the rest of the content irrelevant for current learning needs. They suggest updating the course to reflect modern developments or rebranding it as a different course."
"Initially, I rated this course 5 stars and EVERYTHING was indeed 5 stars till authentication module where everythig was outdated and I thought it's just Authentication module and that's it BUT then React module came after where everything is so outdated that you cannot do a single thing from video without getting an error that says that way of doing it is outdated and no longer supported. I remember from Angela video that she once said that we should rethink twice before buying an outdated udemy course..Huge dissapointment at the end because I could not get a single full project from this course without not watching 8+ hours youtube tutorials to cover the holes from this course...","The reviewer initially gave the course 5 stars, but their experience was ruined by outdated content in both the authentication and React modules, which made it difficult to complete projects despite extensive outside research. They expressed huge disappointment and frustration with the course's lack of support for new technologies."
"Best course ever for web development. No one can match the level of her efforts that she put in making this course. After completion of this course , you will be capable for freelancing. She taught the front end and back end very well. The best thing about this course is that she keep updating the course time to time.","This reviewer highly recommends a web development course, praising its instructor's efforts and thorough coverage of both frontend and backend skills, with the added benefit of regular updates to ensure students stay current."
"The course is good ! BUT I think when teaching everything together is best than separate topics , example creating projects that uses all tecnologies in one project its hard to get on beginning but good to have every thing in a same project , a project like Social Network would be great , I dont know if it exists in the next lessons , but so far has been good , Thanks","The reviewer found the course to be generally good, but suggested that covering multiple topics at once might make it difficult for beginners. They appreciated having everything in one project, such as a hypothetical social network, and hope to see similar projects in future lessons."
"just a average course, she just ask you to read other documentation for even basic concepts and because other documentation aren't for beginners, you need external sources like other youtube channels to understand. there is room for lots of improvement in the course.","The reviewer found the course to be mediocre, requiring students to seek external resources beyond the provided documentation for even basic concepts. The instructor has potential for significant improvement in their teaching methods and content delivery."
"I completed a web development bootcamp and it was an amazing experience. The instructors were knowledgeable, the curriculum was well-structured. Highly recommend it to anyone looking to get into web development.","The reviewer highly recommends a web development bootcamp for those looking to enter the field, citing knowledgeable instructors and a well-structured curriculum."
"This course is best for beginners who want to know the basics of web designing. It may not have some advanced topics that are not necessary for understanding basics. My only suggestion is certification is only provided for completed full courses, I requested the Author provide different types of certificates for front-end, back-end and full-stack. It will also help to attract more students, that's my humble request thankyou.","The course is suitable for beginners looking to learn web designing basics, but lacks advanced topics and a more comprehensive certification option. The reviewer suggests offering different certifications for front-end, back-end, and full-stack development to enhance the course."
"This course has been amazing for me to learn the fundamentals and I think it has been designed in a way for us to get stuck , read a few doc , try to figure it out and move on . Great Job !!","The reviewer found the course to be engaging, encouraging experimentation and self-discovery as they learned the fundamentals. They praised the course design as effective and enjoyable."
Angela has been helping me to get to my educational goals. Having a outstanding teacher has helped me be successful in all of my current projects in her corse. I really love how easy she has made accessing further help on every project & I can go on my own time.,"Angela has been a supportive and effective teacher, helping the student achieve success in their educational goals by providing accessible resources and flexible support."
"This is the third course I have taken from Angela and it's as always highly interesting and project-oriented, if you want to gain leadership in the web realm just take the course and work hard. It's worth the money.","The reviewer found Angela's course to be engaging and valuable for learning leadership skills in the web realm, describing it as 'highly interesting' and a worthwhile investment."
"before taking this course i was a studying coding just by finding long hours YouTube videos and others. but this course was a hidden Jem for me now i found it. it is concise and to the point above all it is time saver. thank you, Angela, for making this course, wish you best of luck in your endeavors!!!","The reviewer discovered a hidden gem in the course, which provided them with valuable information through its conciseness and efficiency. The course was a game-changer for their learning journey."
Angela's course is great and is fun to follow along. I can't provide a perfect score simply because some of the more important parts on the backend segment are outdated. Though I guess some would argue that the struggle to figure out the proper solution is part of the learning process. (It was stressful nonetheless),"The reviewer found Angela's course enjoyable and easy to follow, but noted some technical issues with the backend segment that made it challenging and frustrating. They were unable to give a perfect score due to these outdated components."
I am a manager working to refresh my knowledge and get back into hands-on development. This course has been amazing in how it is structured and how it guides me through concepts. This is what I needed and more.,"The reviewer found the course to be highly effective in refreshing their knowledge and providing a clear guide for learning new concepts, helping them get back into hands-on development."
"Pretty easy to understand they the teacher explains everything, even if you are a complete beginner, this is all you need to go from basic to intermediate, then, of course, you need to figure out how to become a better programmer.","This course is suitable for beginners as it provides clear explanations and builds upon basic knowledge to help students progress from novice to intermediate programmer.
It assumes prior knowledge but still conveys the necessary information for learning programming concepts."
"She is an amazing teacher! Angela's teaching is outstanding. It's easy to understand, her pronunciation is clear, and even though English isn't my native language, I can follow along easily. Her valuable tips and motivational words are a great help for my learning. I highly recommend her lectures.","The reviewer praises Angela's teaching as outstanding, finding her explanations easy to understand and her pronunciation clear. They highly recommend her lectures and attribute their own success in part to her guidance and motivation."
"For this price, it is an amazing course. It covers a wide range of programming knowledge, including GIT, CSS, JS, Node, DB, API, React, JQuery,  Web 3 and etc. The React section is a bit outdated, but the explanations are perfect! I have access to the Laracast platform, and I can make comparisons. In my opinion, Angela has created good practices and provided valuable resources for developers. It's a good starting point. However, I need new knowledge about the latest React 18 and a deeper dive into hooks, etc.","The reviewer considers this course an amazing value for its price, covering a broad range of programming topics and providing clear explanations. While it may lack some newer developments like React 18, it serves as a solid starting point with valuable resources."
"There is a big mismatch and midway updates in some of the course contents . Meanwhile you replaced the section of Mongoose DB with a new section for Postgres DB,  the subsequent sections are talking heavily about the usage of Mongoose. Not Only that but Mongoose is kept as a main part of code structure in Authentication and Security Section and left us suffering either skip this part or searching for proper solutions.","The reviewer found inconsistencies and outdated information within the course, particularly with regards to MongoDB vs Postgres DB, and felt that Mongoose was not accurately represented as a replacement for its previous section on MongoDB."
"She is very good at creating the course, but at this point of time (sept 2023) i am unable to follow her videos as she just went and deleted obsolete videos and didnt warn or do anything then she post a seperate link for old video, but after deleting the videos she didt post the new video in their place, there are few new videos , but you cant understand them if havenot studied the old videos , so basically if you wish to follow this couse you need to first study old course the start new couse , so basically this new course is forcefully inserted , angela you should have posted a new course with updated video and just sell it at a lowest price","The reviewer praises Angela's course creation skills but criticizes her for deleting obsolete videos without warning, making it difficult to follow the new content. They suggest that Angela should offer an updated version of the course instead of forcing students to study the old content first."
"Very very well structured, and the best thing to me in this course is it's not about only learning web development from scratch and knowing the industry used jargons and best practices, but this course also teaches you to learn almost anything and many other useful stuffs. Lots of love for the instructor Dr. Angela Yu.","The reviewer praises a course for its well-structured approach, which goes beyond just teaching web development fundamentals by providing broader knowledge and useful skills. The instructor, Dr. Angela Yu, is particularly appreciated for her teaching style."
"I started this course a month ago. I found this interesting till the end of frontend module. As of now the backend modules are completely outdated. The frontend section is amazing as it's up to date. but the backend lectures are from 2018 and the technologies are changed. So, I request to check the course backend section at the time of your purchase. Again, if you want to become a frontend developer you can go for it. Please update the course as soon as possible.","The reviewer found the course's frontend module interesting and up-to-date but was disappointed by its outdated backend module content from 2018. They recommend potential students focus on the frontend section, which is still current, and request an update to the course content."
"As a software professional on the embedded side that has wanting to make a jump to the web side, this is EXACTLY what I was looking for. With that being said, it starts off at a perfect pace for a beginner as well, with plenty of challenges along the way to test and refine knowledge as it's gained instead of hurrying off to the next topic.","A software professional finds this book suitable as a transition from embedded development to web development, offering a gentle learning pace that tests and refines their growing knowledge."
"I recommend to take 100 days of code using Python then proceed to this bootcamp. Python will give you better understanding because of lesser code than Javascript. and also they have some same videos for basic HTML and some code, which is really good to think without looking at the solution. you can also see the difference when using else if statement.","The reviewer recommends taking a Python-focused 100-day coding course before enrolling in this bootcamp, citing Python's lower amount of code as beneficial for understanding. They also appreciate the bootcamp's video content for HTML and JavaScript basics."
"Really good course, you need to dig in on some documentation because the outdated data, but this helps to improve your skills on reading the documentation the proper way. 100% recommended.","This course is highly recommended for improving skills in reading and utilizing technical documentation, although students should be aware of outdated data that requires additional research."
"Not only is a very complete course, the way is explanined is so fun, didactic and detailed. No extra music on the background, a pleasant voice pitch and the diction of the teacher is just perfect.","The reviewer highly praises this course for its completeness, engaging teaching style, and high-quality audio, citing a pleasant voice pitch and clear diction as standout features."
Angela has so much enthusiasm and it comes across in everything she says. Content is very interesting and informative - need to move on to the next lesson as soon as the last one has finished.,"Angela is an engaging instructor with high energy, making the content of her lessons both captivating and informative. She effectively conveys enthusiasm that keeps students motivated and eager to continue learning."
It's a very comprehensive course in terms of the topics covered. But I think the quality of the javascript section in this course is not upto the mark. There are lots of think which are important but are not covered eg. Promise API.,"This course covers a wide range of topics, but lacks depth and comprehensive coverage in its JavaScript section, particularly with regards to important concepts such as the Promise API."
"The course has complicated topics in it, a few classes might be confusing, but overall Dr Angela explains things in a clear, concise manner, and she's always pushing people to keep going by the end of each module. Thoroughly recommend it.","The reviewer praises the instructor, Dr. Angela, for explaining complex topics clearly, despite some modules being confusing. They highly recommend the course overall."
It was a really excellent course I learned a lot from it. Before taking this course I did not know anything about web development but after taking this course I can say that I am now web-developer,"The reviewer found an online course to be exceptionally beneficial, transforming their career trajectory from zero knowledge in web development to becoming a web developer themselves."
"This being my first web development course, I felt a tremendous sense of accomplishment upon completing it, and I attribute this success to Angela Yu's exceptional teaching. While this course may not make you a fully-fledged developer, it certainly motivates you to explore further and equips you with valuable insights on how to learn, apply your knowledge, and identify areas for growth. It serves as an excellent introduction to the vast world of web development. Admittedly, the course content is somewhat outdated, necessitating the use of additional resources. Nevertheless, considering its price, this course is an absolute gem. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Angela for her mentorship and the impressive way she delivers her lessons.","The reviewer praises Angela Yu's teaching in a web development course, finding it motivating and informative, despite some limitations such as outdated content. They highly recommend the course due to its value for the price."
"It's definitely worth it to buy this course. Specially i was struggling one of the important topics in programming API that Angela deep dive into this field. She taught both frontend and backend topics detailed, subtitle is clear. Teaching process is fun, Angela's advertisement is valuable at the end of each section and keep motivate me. I highly recommend this course to new beginners.","The reviewer recommends this programming API course, citing Angela's thorough teaching, engaging presentation style, and motivational approach as reasons for its value."
Because it's very help full for me. When I start this course I just know about the HTML and CSS but letter on I got to much from this course. And it helps me to be the one in my life. I just start but now I can do much more in my Web career. And I give four star because of one or two module are not completely update.,"The reviewer credits the course with significantly expanding their knowledge and skills in web development, allowing them to advance in their career. Despite giving 4 stars, they mention that only a couple of modules were outdated."
"Awesome course! Everything is expressed an explained straight to the point. I come from learning how to code from books which gives a deeper understanding, I wish that I started out with her videos to save time. I moved from books to this course for the exercises, quizzes and projects to make sure that I utilize, practice, and retain the material.","The reviewer found the course to be straightforward and to-the-point, praising its effectiveness in conveying information. They prefer starting with video lessons over reading books due to the comprehensive nature of the content and ability to apply it through exercises and quizzes."

Thank you, Angela and her team, for making my dream to become a developer possible! <3","This reviewer praises Angela and her team for creating a valuable learning experience, saying they helped make their dream of becoming a developer a reality."
"Everything is awesome, but as a mobile user I'm unable to do coding exercises, if there is anything that mobile users install and do coding exercises, please do mention it,it will help a lot.","The reviewer enjoyed the course content, but was disappointed that mobile users cannot access or complete coding exercises due to technical limitations."
great course for intermediate programmers but not for beginner i guess cause some topics of advancejava script has OOPS concept that means the person who didnt know programming language before would not understand.,"This review states that the course is suitable for intermediate programmers, but not beginners due to advanced topics like object-oriented scripting that may confuse those unfamiliar with programming concepts."
"An impressive course! It is very well structured, concise and very useful due to the practical part that requires the student's involvement in creating applications. I recommend this course!","The reviewer highly recommends the course, praising its structure, conciseness, and hands-on approach with practical exercises."
"It's definitely challenging, but I'm able to understand and continue with the modules. I can't know for sure if I'll be able to successfully become a software engineer, but if I don't, it will be on me because the Instructor is teaching good, giving many examples and exercises. So far I'm happy with this course.","The reviewer finds the course challenging, but feels they can learn from the instructor's guidance and exercises. They are initially skeptical about their ability to become a software engineer, but remain happy with the course so far."
"Course is great and all explanations are clear. But there are several missed concepts. The React section don't cover everything like Router, useEffect and others. Even if they covered in Web3 section I think it would be better if it will be on React section too. In my opinion after this course not everyone will start carrer on Web3. It would be better if there are more big projects like building NFT Marketplace but combining React, PostgreSQL and NodeJS together. Some courses should be updated too but it is not big problem.","The reviewer found the course explanations clear, but noted that some concepts, such as Router in React, were missing or covered elsewhere. They suggested adding more comprehensive projects to the curriculum."
outdated mongodb section and overall outdate course.you can still use this as a guide by reading new documentation for the respective tech and looking at new comments can help you find solution,"The reviewer found MongoDB to be outdated in its coverage within the course material, leading them to express dissatisfaction with the course's relevance. Despite this, they suggest that the content remains somewhat useful if supplemented by more modern documentation and community comments."
"I really loved this course. Angela's teaching style is very engaging, and it feels as though she is speaking directly to you at times. She explains the concepts very well and provides challenges along the way to practice what you've just learned. I very much enjoyed this course, and I hope that she teaches courses on other development technologies soon.","The reviewer thoroughly enjoyed a course taught by Angela, praising her engaging teaching style and ability to explain complex concepts effectively. They expressed hope for future courses on related topics, suggesting high quality instruction from the instructor."
"The only thing i didn't like was that when i was doing this course all my technology versions were way ahead of what were used in this course and this lead to many many issues and problem. Even to some point that I had to leave that section and move forward. The most problematic sections were the website deploy, the crypto and the NFT ones.","The reviewer experienced several technical difficulties while taking a course, particularly with website deployment, cryptocurrency, and NFT-related topics, which made it hard for them to keep up with the instruction's technology versions."
"Angela, you are so sweet and kind, but I was expecting a beginner friendly course. I hate the fact that we don't code along with you and I hate the fact that you expect us to solve an exercise before you showing us how to do it. It's like you expect a child to eat by himself, but he never was taught how...","Angela's reviewer found her course to be not beginner-friendly, citing frustration with hands-on coding exercises and the expectation that students solve problems without guidance."
"It was really fun learning to be a web developer but I had a lot of problems, sometimes I didn't understand the programming logic and sometimes I felt frustrated because my program didn't work. So I really repeated a lot of explanations so it could be said that my progress was not that fast. However, I felt this was the challenge and I continued to progress and learn until I became a junior web developer in the future.","The reviewer enjoyed learning to become a web developer but faced challenges with understanding programming logic, leading to frustrating moments, yet they persevered and eventually achieved their goal of becoming a junior web developer."
"I recently completed Angela's course, and I must say it was an outstanding experience. The course was incredibly engaging and entertaining throughout. Angela's teaching style is not only informative but also very enjoyable.","The reviewer found Angela's online course to be highly engaging, entertaining, and well-structured, with a teaching style that effectively balances information with enjoyment."
"I enrolled in Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp 2023 with high hopes after completing the initial 32 sections, which were relatively up to date and well-structured. However, my experience took a nosedive once I reached Section 33, which focused on MongoDB.",The reviewer initially had promising expectations for Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp 2023 but was disappointed when it devolved into a weak section on MongoDB after the first 32 lessons. The reviewer found the transition to be abrupt and disappointing.
"Angela Yu's full-stack web development course has its pros and cons. The HTML and CSS sections stand out for their clear explanations and thorough content coverage. However, the JavaScript portion, particularly the function section, falls short. Understanding how to return values can be challenging, and the examples provided may not always be helpful or relevant, leading to confusion instead of clarity.","Angela Yu's full-stack web development course has its strengths in HTML/CSS coverage but falters in JavaScript, particularly with function concepts. This inconsistency makes the course less effective for learners seeking a comprehensive understanding of all programming aspects."
"The best web development online bootcamp money can get, the instructor is great and friendly, the course is engaging overall I am so happy that I took this course. Thank you, Dr. Angela Yu and Greetings from Egypt, :).","This reviewer thoroughly enjoyed a web development online bootcamp taught by Dr. Angela Yu, finding the instructor and course to be both effective and enjoyable."
"This is the worst course I have ever taken in my entire life. The videos are very old, there are no resources, some resources don't work anymore, and the websites it recommends no longer exist. As you watch videos, the instructor removes them randomly, and the videos are all messed up. This course is a total waste of time. There are so many better courses available for free.","The reviewer had a disastrous experience with this course due to outdated videos, lack of resources, and unusable recommendations. They found it to be a complete waste of time and recommend alternative, free options instead."
"I am absolutely thrilled with this course! The course covers a wide range of web development topics, providing a comprehensive and up-to-date curriculum and Dr Angelas Yus teaching style really encourages you to push forward. Will definitely come back and review.","The reviewer is extremely satisfied with the course, praising its comprehensive coverage of web development topics and engaging instructor. They express enthusiasm for potentially returning to review the course in the future."
