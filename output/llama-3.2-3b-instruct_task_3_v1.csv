review,summary
HTML and CSS if very nicely covered but later sections are recorded more than 4 years back and now each and everything has updated so much that it became a pathetic experience to follow this course. This course should be updated totally or should not be named as web development bootcamp 2023?,"The reviewer praises the course's coverage of HTML and CSS but criticizes its outdated sections, which were recorded more than 4 years ago. The course's lack of updates since then renders it less relevant and an unenjoyable learning experience."
"Initially, I rated this course 5 stars and EVERYTHING was indeed 5 stars till authentication module where everythig was outdated and I thought it's just Authentication module and that's it BUT then React module came after where everything is so outdated that you cannot do a single thing from video without getting an error that says that way of doing it is outdated and no longer supported. I remember from Angela video that she once said that we should rethink twice before buying an outdated udemy course..Huge dissapointment at the end because I could not get a single full project from this course without not watching 8+ hours youtube tutorials to cover the holes from this course...","The reviewer initially gave the course high marks but became disappointed when they found out that multiple modules, including React and authentication, were outdated and caused errors in their work. The course's lack of compatibility with modern development practices led to significant frustration."
"Best course ever for web development. No one can match the level of her efforts that she put in making this course. After completion of this course , you will be capable for freelancing. She taught the front end and back end very well. The best thing about this course is that she keep updating the course time to time.","This reviewer highly recommends the course as the most comprehensive and up-to-date resource for web development, praising the instructor's expertise and dedication to regularly updating the curriculum. Upon completing the course, students will gain sufficient skills to pursue freelance work in front-end and back-end development."
"The course is good ! BUT I think when teaching everything together is best than separate topics , example creating projects that uses all tecnologies in one project its hard to get on beginning but good to have every thing in a same project , a project like Social Network would be great , I dont know if it exists in the next lessons , but so far has been good , Thanks","The reviewer finds the course to be good overall, suggesting that teaching everything together at once might be more effective than breaking topics down separately. They also propose a project idea inspired by Social Network, which they hope will be included in future lessons."
"just a average course, she just ask you to read other documentation for even basic concepts and because other documentation aren't for beginners, you need external sources like other youtube channels to understand. there is room for lots of improvement in the course.",This reviewer found the course to be

They highly recommend the program to those interested in getting into web development."
"This course is best for beginners who want to know the basics of web designing. It may not have some advanced topics that are not necessary for understanding basics. My only suggestion is certification is only provided for completed full courses, I requested the Author provide different types of certificates for front-end, back-end and full-stack. It will also help to attract more students, that's my humble request thankyou.","This course is suitable for beginners seeking basic web design knowledge, but lacks advanced topics. The instructor could consider offering different certification options for front-end, back-end, and full-stack development to attract a wider range of students."
"This course has been amazing for me to learn the fundamentals and I think it has been designed in a way for us to get stuck , read a few doc , try to figure it out and move on . Great Job !!",The reviewer found the course to be an

It's worth the money.","A student praises Angela's course for being highly engaging, project-oriented, and well worth the investment."
"before taking this course i was a studying coding just by finding long hours YouTube videos and others. but this course was a hidden Jem for me now i found it. it is concise and to the point above all it is time saver. thank you, Angela, for making this course, wish you best of luck in your endeavors!!!","The reviewer, who previously studied coding through YouTube videos, praises a course as ""a hidden gem"" that is concise, time-saving, and highly effective. They express gratitude to the course creator, Angela, and offer their well-wishes for her future endeavors."
Angela's course is great and is fun to follow along. I can't provide a perfect score simply because some of the more important parts on the backend segment are outdated. Though I guess some would argue that the struggle to figure out the proper solution is part of the learning process. (It was stressful nonetheless),"The reviewer enjoyed Angela's course as it was fun and easy to follow, but noted some issues with the backend segment that were outdated and caused stress during the learning process."
I am a manager working to refresh my knowledge and get back into hands-on development. This course has been amazing in how it is structured and how it guides me through concepts. This is what I needed and more.,"A manager, seeking to update their technical skills, found this course to be comprehensive and well-structured, exceeding their expectations."

They wholeheartedly endorse her classes."
"For this price, it is an amazing course. It covers a wide range of programming knowledge, including GIT, CSS, JS, Node, DB, API, React, JQuery,  Web 3 and etc. The React section is a bit outdated, but the explanations are perfect! I have access to the Laracast platform, and I can make comparisons. In my opinion, Angela has created good practices and provided valuable resources for developers. It's a good starting point. However, I need new knowledge about the latest React 18 and a deeper dive into hooks, etc.","The reviewer finds the course to be an amazing value at its price, covering a broad range of programming topics including React, Node, DB, and more. They appreciate Angela's teaching style but feel that some areas, like React 18, are outdated and could benefit from further explanation."
"There is a big mismatch and midway updates in some of the course contents . Meanwhile you replaced the section of Mongoose DB with a new section for Postgres DB,  the subsequent sections are talking heavily about the usage of Mongoose. Not Only that but Mongoose is kept as a main part of code structure in Authentication and Security Section and left us suffering either skip this part or searching for proper solutions.","The reviewer found significant inconsistencies in the course content, including outdated information and mismatched topics, particularly between MongoDB and PostgreSQL, which led to confusion while learning authentication and security concepts using Mongoose."
"She is very good at creating the course, but at this point of time (sept 2023) i am unable to follow her videos as she just went and deleted obsolete videos and didnt warn or do anything then she post a seperate link for old video, but after deleting the videos she didt post the new video in their place, there are few new videos , but you cant understand them if havenot studied the old videos , so basically if you wish to follow this couse you need to first study old course the start new couse , so basically this new course is forcefully inserted , angela you should have posted a new course with updated video and just sell it at a lowest price","The instructor, Angela, has updated her course content but removed outdated videos without warning or replacing them, making it difficult for students to follow without prior knowledge of the old material. This has resulted in an inconvenience, leading the student to suggest she create a new course with updated videos instead."
"Very very well structured, and the best thing to me in this course is it's not about only learning web development from scratch and knowing the industry used jargons and best practices, but this course also teaches you to learn almost anything and many other useful stuffs. Lots of love for the instructor Dr. Angela Yu.","The reviewer praises the structure and breadth of a course taught by Dr. Angela Yu, finding it not only comprehensive in web development but also providing a broad range of skills and knowledge beyond that."
"I started this course a month ago. I found this interesting till the end of frontend module. As of now the backend modules are completely outdated. The frontend section is amazing as it's up to date. but the backend lectures are from 2018 and the technologies are changed. So, I request to check the course backend section at the time of your purchase. Again, if you want to become a frontend developer you can go for it. Please update the course as soon as possible.","A student who started this online course found the frontend module engaging but became disappointed with the outdated backend modules from 2018, recommending potential buyers to verify the backend section before purchasing."
"As a software professional on the embedded side that has wanting to make a jump to the web side, this is EXACTLY what I was looking for. With that being said, it starts off at a perfect pace for a beginner as well, with plenty of challenges along the way to test and refine knowledge as it's gained instead of hurrying off to the next topic.","The reviewer found this resource perfectly paced for beginners, with challenges that allowed them to refine their knowledge as they progressed."
"I recommend to take 100 days of code using Python then proceed to this bootcamp. Python will give you better understanding because of lesser code than Javascript. and also they have some same videos for basic HTML and some code, which is really good to think without looking at the solution. you can also see the difference when using else if statement.","The reviewer recommends starting with a 100-day Python coding course before pursuing this bootcamp, as it will provide a better foundation in programming concepts. They also appreciate the bootcamp's reuse of basic HTML videos and code examples for comparison."
"Really good course, you need to dig in on some documentation because the outdated data, but this helps to improve your skills on reading the documentation the proper way. 100% recommended.","The reviewer found the course to be really good and highly recommended it, although they noted that outdated data may require digging into documentation for context."

Content is very interesting and informative - need to move on to the next lesson as soon as the last one has finished.,"Angela's energetic teaching style makes her content engaging and informative, making the student eager to progress to the next lesson."
It's a very comprehensive course in terms of the topics covered. But I think the quality of the javascript section in this course is not upto the mark. There are lots of think which are important but are not covered eg. Promise API.,"The reviewer praises the course for its comprehensive coverage, but criticizes the JavaScript section as lacking in certain key topics such as Promise API."
"The course has complicated topics in it, a few classes might be confusing, but overall Dr Angela explains things in a clear, concise manner, and she's always pushing people to keep going by the end of each module. Thoroughly recommend it.","The instructor, Dr. Angela, makes complex course material understandable with clear explanations and encouragement."

While this course may not make you a fully-fledged developer, it certainly motivates you to explore further and equips you with valuable insights on how to learn, apply your knowledge, and identify areas for growth. It serves as an excellent introduction to the vast world of web development. Admittedly, the course content is somewhat outdated, necessitating the use of additional resources. Nevertheless, considering its price, this course is an absolute gem. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Angela for her mentorship and the impressive way she delivers her lessons.","The reviewer credits Angela Yu's teaching with their success in the web development course, feeling motivated and empowered despite some outdated content that requires additional resources."
"It's definitely worth it to buy this course. Specially i was struggling one of the important topics in programming API that Angela deep dive into this field.

I highly recommend this course to new beginners.","The reviewer thoroughly enjoyed Angela's programming API course, citing its value, clarity, and motivational elements as reasons for a strong recommendation for new beginners."
Because it's very help full for me. When I start this course I just know about the HTML and CSS but letter on I got to much from this course. And it helps me to be the one in my life. I just start but now I can do much more in my Web career. And I give four star because of one or two module are not completely update.,"The reviewer credits the course with significantly improving their skills, especially after starting from a basic foundation in HTML and CSS, and feels it has helped them advance in their web career."
"Awesome course! Everything is expressed an explained straight to the point. I come from learning how to code from books which gives a deeper understanding, I wish that I started out with her videos to save time. I moved from books to this course for the exercises, quizzes and projects to make sure that I utilize, practice, and retain the material.","The reviewer found this course to be effective and straightforward, making it easy to understand key concepts."

great course for intermediate programmers but not for beginner i guess cause some topics of advancejava script has OOPS concept that means the person who didnt know programming language before would not understand.,"This reviewer found the course suitable for intermediate programmers, but deemed it unsuitable for beginners due to its advanced concepts."
"An impressive course! It is very well structured, concise and very useful due to the practical part that requires the student's involvement in creating applications. I recommend this course!","This reviewer found the course to be highly structured and useful, with a hands-on component that made learning engaging and effective. They wholeheartedly recommend the course to others."
"It's definitely challenging, but I'm able to understand and continue with the modules. I can't know for sure if I'll be able to successfully become a software engineer, but if I don't, it will be on me because the Instructor is teaching good, giving many examples and exercises. So far I'm happy with this course.","The reviewer found the course challenging but manageable, and appreciates the instructor's guidance and support. They are satisfied with their progress so far, despite acknowledging that success is still uncertain."
"Course is great and all explanations are clear. But there are several missed concepts. The React section don't cover everything like Router, useEffect and others. Even if they covered in Web3 section I think it would be better if it will be on React section too. In my opinion after this course not everyone will start carrer on Web3. It would be better if there are more big projects like building NFT Marketplace but combining React, PostgreSQL and NodeJS together. Some courses should be updated too but it is not big problem.","The reviewer found the course to be clear in explanations but noted several missing concepts, particularly around React-related topics. They suggested adding more comprehensive coverage of React features and incorporating real-world projects like NFT marketplaces for a stronger foundation."
outdated mongodb section and overall outdate course.you can still use this as a guide by reading new documentation for the respective tech and looking at new comments can help you find solution,"The reviewer found the MongoDB section and the entire course to be outdated, but noted that newer documentation and comments can still provide helpful guidance."
"I really loved this course. Angela's teaching style is very engaging, and it feels as though she is speaking directly to you at times.

They are eager for future courses by Angela on related topics."
"The only thing i didn't like was that when i was doing this course all my technology versions were way ahead of what were used in this course and this lead to many many issues and problem. Even to some point that I had to leave that section and move forward. The most problematic sections were the website deploy, the crypto and the NFT ones.","The reviewer experienced technical difficulties due to outdated technology versions used in the course, which caused frustration and forced them to skip certain sections."
"Angela, you are so sweet and kind, but I was expecting a beginner friendly course. I hate the fact that we don't code along with you and I hate the fact that you expect us to solve an exercise before you showing us how to do it. It's like you expect a child to eat by himself, but he never was taught how...","A student felt overwhelmed by a course they expected to be beginner-friendly, with instructor-led coding exercises rather than following along themselves."
"It was really fun learning to be a web developer but I had a lot of problems, sometimes I didn't understand the programming logic and sometimes I felt frustrated because my program didn't work. So I really repeated a lot of explanations so it could be said that my progress was not that fast. However, I felt this was the challenge and I continued to progress and learn until I became a junior web developer in the future.","The reviewer found learning to be a web developer to be both fun and challenging, with frustrating moments of confusion and repeated explanations, but ultimately persisted and made significant progress."

"I enrolled in Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp 2023 with high hopes after completing the initial 32 sections, which were relatively up to date and well-structured. However, my experience took a nosedive once I reached Section 33, which focused on MongoDB.","The reviewer began Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp feeling confident but quickly lost interest after hitting a snag with the MongoDB section in Module 33. Despite initial enthusiasm for the course's first 32 sections, their experience took a downturn from there."
"Angela Yu's full-stack web development course has its pros and cons. The HTML and CSS sections stand out for their clear explanations and thorough content coverage. However, the JavaScript portion, particularly the function section, falls short. Understanding how to return values can be challenging, and the examples provided may not always be helpful or relevant, leading to confusion instead of clarity.","Angela Yu's full-stack web development course has its strengths in HTML, CSS, and weak points in JavaScript, particularly with returning values."
"The best web development online bootcamp money can get, the instructor is great and friendly, the course is engaging overall I am so happy that I took this course. Thank you, Dr. Angela Yu and Greetings from Egypt, :).","The reviewer highly recommends the online bootcamp for its excellent instructor and engaging content, stating they are extremely satisfied with their experience."
"This is the worst course I have ever taken in my entire life. The videos are very old, there are no resources, some resources don't work anymore, and the websites it recommends no longer exist. As you watch videos, the instructor removes them randomly, and the videos are all messed up. This course is a total waste of time. There are so many better courses available for free.","The reviewer had a terrible experience with this course, citing outdated materials, broken resources, and poor video quality that made it impossible to learn from."
"I am absolutely thrilled with this course! The course covers a wide range of web development topics, providing a comprehensive and up-to-date curriculum and Dr Angelas Yus teaching style really encourages you to push forward.
