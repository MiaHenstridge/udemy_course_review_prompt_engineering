review,summary
HTML and CSS if very nicely covered but later sections are recorded more than 4 years back and now each and everything has updated so much that it became a pathetic experience to follow this course. This course should be updated totally or should not be named as web development bootcamp 2023?,"Customer found the early sections of HTML and CSS in the course to be well-covered, but had a frustrating experience following outdated later sections that didn't align with current industry standards. They suggested the course either undergo significant updates or consider rebranding as a more accurate representation of modern web development training."
"Initially, I rated this course 5 stars and EVERYTHING was indeed 5 stars till authentication module where everythig was outdated and I thought it's just Authentication module and that's it BUT then React module came after where everything is so outdated that you cannot do a single thing from video without getting an error that says that way of doing it is outdated and no longer supported. I remember from Angela video that she once said that we should rethink twice before buying an outdated udemy course..Huge dissapointment at the end because I could not get a single full project from this course without not watching 8+ hours youtube tutorials to cover the holes from this course...","The customer was initially very satisfied with the course, but became frustrated when they discovered that the Authentication and React modules were outdated and no longer supported. They felt misled by the instructor's earlier words of caution and ended up wasting a significant amount of time trying to complete projects despite YouTube tutorials covering the gaps from the course."
"Best course ever for web development. No one can match the level of her efforts that she put in making this course. After completion of this course , you will be capable for freelancing. She taught the front end and back end very well. The best thing about this course is that she keep updating the course time to time.","This customer highly praised the instructor's dedication and effort, stating that it's the 'best course ever' for web development, and feels confident in their ability to freelance after completing it. They commended the instructor's thorough coverage of front end and back end skills, as well as her commitment to regular updates."
"The course is good ! BUT I think when teaching everything together is best than separate topics , example creating projects that uses all tecnologies in one project its hard to get on beginning but good to have every thing in a same project , a project like Social Network would be great , I dont know if it exists in the next lessons , but so far has been good , Thanks","The customer finds the course generally satisfactory, with one main suggestion: they prefer learning by integrating topics and technologies through real-world projects, rather than separate modules. A project-based approach would make it easier to grasp complex concepts, such as those found in a hypothetical Social Network project."
"just a average course, she just ask you to read other documentation for even basic concepts and because other documentation aren't for beginners, you need external sources like other youtube channels to understand. there is room for lots of improvement in the course.","The customer found the online course to be somewhat lacking in clarity and depth, requiring additional external resources to grasp basic concepts. While they acknowledged some areas for improvement, they felt the course didn't adequately cater to beginners and left them seeking extra support beyond the provided documentation."
"I completed a web development bootcamp and it was an amazing experience. The instructors were knowledgeable, the curriculum was well-structured. Highly recommend it to anyone looking to get into web development.","The student thoroughly enjoyed the web development bootcamp, praising the instructors' knowledge and the structured curriculum, and highly recommends it to others seeking a similar career path. Overall, they found the experience to be amazing and a great investment in their future."
"This course is best for beginners who want to know the basics of web designing. It may not have some advanced topics that are not necessary for understanding basics. My only suggestion is certification is only provided for completed full courses, I requested the Author provide different types of certificates for front-end, back-end and full-stack. It will also help to attract more students, that's my humble request thankyou.","This beginner-friendly course excels at teaching the fundamentals of web designing but may lack depth on advanced topics. The customer suggests an update to include certificate options for different areas of specialization (front-end, back-end, full-stack) to make it more appealing and attractive to potential students."
"This course has been amazing for me to learn the fundamentals and I think it has been designed in a way for us to get stuck , read a few doc , try to figure it out and move on . Great Job !!","This customer found the online course engaging and effective, as it provided a hands-on learning experience that encouraged exploration and problem-solving, making them feel like they were actively learning the fundamentals. They expressed high praise for the course's design, stating it was done in a way that would challenge students to think critically."
Angela has been helping me to get to my educational goals. Having a outstanding teacher has helped me be successful in all of my current projects in her corse.

It's worth the money.","The learner found this course by Angela to be highly engaging, project-based, and valuable for gaining leadership skills in the online world. They highly recommend it and state that it's worth the investment."
"before taking this course i was a studying coding just by finding long hours YouTube videos and others. but this course was a hidden Jem for me now i found it. it is concise and to the point above all it is time saver. thank you, Angela, for making this course, wish you best of luck in your endeavors!!!","Angela's online course exceeded expectations as a game-changer for coding learners like herself, offering a concise and efficient approach that saved her valuable study time. She expresses gratitude and appreciation for the instructor's effort, wishing them success with future projects."
Angela's course is great and is fun to follow along. I can't provide a perfect score simply because some of the more important parts on the backend segment are outdated. Though I guess some would argue that the struggle to figure out the proper solution is part of the learning process. (It was stressful nonetheless),"Angela's course is an enjoyable and engaging learning experience, with some valuable insights into web development, but notes a need for updates on backend segment information and acknowledges potential frustration with outdated content."
I am a manager working to refresh my knowledge and get back into hands-on development. This course has been amazing in how it is structured and how it guides me through concepts. This is what I needed and more.,"Customer appreciates the course's structured approach, which effectively guided them through complex concepts and met their need for a refresher on hands-on development. The experience was described as 'amazing' and exceeded expectations."
"Pretty easy to understand they the teacher explains everything, even if you are a complete beginner, this is all you need to go from basic to intermediate, then, of course, you need to figure out how to become a better programmer.","The teacher's clear explanations made it easy for the learner to grasp complex concepts, even as a complete beginner. The course effectively covered the basics, preparing learners for further growth into more advanced programming skills."
"She is an amazing teacher! Angela's teaching is outstanding. It's easy to understand, her pronunciation is clear, and even though English isn't my native language, I can follow along easily. Her valuable tips and motivational words are a great help for my learning. I highly recommend her lectures.","Angela's engaging and clear teaching style makes the online course accessible and enjoyable, providing valuable tips and motivation to learners like me who may not be native English speakers."
"For this price, it is an amazing course. It covers a wide range of programming knowledge, including GIT, CSS, JS, Node, DB, API, React, JQuery,  Web 3 and etc. The React section is a bit outdated, but the explanations are perfect! I have access to the Laracast platform, and I can make comparisons. In my opinion, Angela has created good practices and provided valuable resources for developers. It's a good starting point. However, I need new knowledge about the latest React 18 and a deeper dive into hooks, etc.","This customer finds the course to be an excellent value despite some outdated content in specific areas, citing Angela's clear explanations as a strength. The overall experience is seen as a good starting point for developers, but with some additional knowledge gaps that would benefit from more recent updates."
"There is a big mismatch and midway updates in some of the course contents . Meanwhile you replaced the section of Mongoose DB with a new section for Postgres DB,  the subsequent sections are talking heavily about the usage of Mongoose. Not Only that but Mongoose is kept as a main part of code structure in Authentication and Security Section and left us suffering either skip this part or searching for proper solutions.","Customers felt frustrated by the inconsistent updates and mismatched content throughout the course, particularly in the sections following the change from Mongoose to Postgres DB. The continued emphasis on Mongoose usage caused confusion and unnecessary challenges in completing the course."
"She is very good at creating the course, but at this point of time (sept 2023) i am unable to follow her videos as she just went and deleted obsolete videos and didnt warn or do anything then she post a seperate link for old video, but after deleting the videos she didt post the new video in their place, there are few new videos , but you cant understand them if havenot studied the old videos , so basically if you wish to follow this couse you need to first study old course the start new couse , so basically this new course is forcefully inserted , angela you should have posted a new course with updated video and just sell it at a lowest price","Customer is frustrated that the instructor suddenly deleted obsolete videos without warning, leaving students struggling to follow the new content, which requires prior study of old videos. They felt that the instructor should have created a separate updated version of the course instead of forcing students to revisit and rewatch older material."
"Very very well structured, and the best thing to me in this course is it's not about only learning web development from scratch and knowing the industry used jargons and best practices, but this course also teaches you to learn almost anything and many other useful stuffs. Lots of love for the instructor Dr. Angela Yu.","The customer appreciated the well-structured course for its holistic approach to learning, which goes beyond just web development basics and incorporates valuable skills and knowledge that can be applied across multiple domains. They also praised Dr. Angela Yu's instruction, expressing their affection for her teaching style."
"I started this course a month ago. I found this interesting till the end of frontend module. As of now the backend modules are completely outdated. The frontend section is amazing as it's up to date. but the backend lectures are from 2018 and the technologies are changed. So, I request to check the course backend section at the time of your purchase. Again, if you want to become a frontend developer you can go for it. Please update the course as soon as possible.","Although the course excelled in its frontend module, the customer felt that the outdated backend modules hindered their learning experience due to rapidly changing technologies. The instructor is advised to review and update the course content to better align with current industry standards."
"As a software professional on the embedded side that has wanting to make a jump to the web side, this is EXACTLY what I was looking for. With that being said, it starts off at a perfect pace for a beginner as well, with plenty of challenges along the way to test and refine knowledge as it's gained instead of hurrying off to the next topic.","This customer found the course to be perfectly paced for both beginners and experienced professionals looking to make a transition from embedded to web development, offering a challenging yet supportive learning environment that effectively builds upon previous knowledge."
"I recommend to take 100 days of code using Python then proceed to this bootcamp. Python will give you better understanding because of lesser code than Javascript. and also they have some same videos for basic HTML and some code, which is really good to think without looking at the solution. you can also see the difference when using else if statement.","This customer recommends starting with 100 Days of Code using Python to gain a solid foundation before proceeding to this bootcamp, citing Python's simplicity and less code as an advantage over JavaScript. They praise the bootcamp for offering similar videos on basic HTML concepts without showing solutions, allowing students to practice critical thinking skills."
"Really good course, you need to dig in on some documentation because the outdated data, but this helps to improve your skills on reading the documentation the proper way. 100% recommended.","This learner found the online course to be 'really good', citing improved skills in utilizing documentation and navigating outdated information, with a strong recommendation for others."

The course content is highly interesting and informative, with a strong desire to complete all lessons as quickly as possible."
It's a very comprehensive course in terms of the topics covered. But I think the quality of the javascript section in this course is not upto the mark. There are lots of think which are important but are not covered eg. Promise API.,"This course covers an extensive range of topics, although some learners felt that certain crucial aspects, such as the JavaScript section, were not adequately explored. Specifically, they noted that key concepts like Promise API were omitted from the lessons."
"The course has complicated topics in it, a few classes might be confusing, but overall Dr Angela explains things in a clear, concise manner, and she's always pushing people to keep going by the end of each module. Thoroughly recommend it.","Customers praise Dr Angela for explaining complex topics clearly and concisely, while acknowledging that some modules may require extra effort to grasp. Overall, they highly recommend the course for its engaging teaching style and supportive approach."

And I give four star because of one or two module are not completely update.,"This customer found the online course incredibly helpful, especially after having a strong foundation in HTML and CSS, allowing them to expand their web development skills and advance in their career. Although they gave 4/5 stars due to outdated modules, they highly recommend the course for its overall value and impact on their professional growth."
"Awesome course! Everything is expressed an explained straight to the point. I come from learning how to code from books which gives a deeper understanding, I wish that I started out with her videos to save time. I moved from books to this course for the exercises, quizzes and projects to make sure that I utilize, practice, and retain the material.","This customer thoroughly enjoyed the online course, appreciating its clear and concise explanations and the value it added by providing hands-on exercises and projects to reinforce learning. They wished they had started with this approach from the beginning of their coding journey, rather than relying on books."

Overall, they expressed enthusiasm and appreciation for the course's content."
great course for intermediate programmers but not for beginner i guess cause some topics of advancejava script has OOPS concept that means the person who didnt know programming language before would not understand.,"This course is geared towards intermediate programmers, with advanced JavaScript topics including OOPS concepts that may be challenging for beginners to follow. While it's a great resource for those already familiar with programming basics, it may not provide enough foundational knowledge for complete newcomers to the field."

I recommend this course!","Students found the online course to be well-structured, concise, and extremely useful due to its hands-on application component, making it an impressive learning experience."
"It's definitely challenging, but I'm able to understand and continue with the modules. I can't know for sure if I'll be able to successfully become a software engineer, but if I don't, it will be on me because the Instructor is teaching good, giving many examples and exercises. So far I'm happy with this course.","This customer finds the online course challenging but appreciates the instructor's clear teaching style, providing valuable examples and exercises that keep them engaged and motivated. Overall, they are satisfied with the course so far, even if they're uncertain about their future success as a software engineer."
"Course is great and all explanations are clear. But there are several missed concepts. The React section don't cover everything like Router, useEffect and others. Even if they covered in Web3 section I think it would be better if it will be on React section too. In my opinion after this course not everyone will start carrer on Web3. It would be better if there are more big projects like building NFT Marketplace but combining React, PostgreSQL and NodeJS together. Some courses should be updated too but it is not big problem.","Customer praises the clarity of explanations in the course but expresses disappointment with missing concepts, particularly in the React section, and feels that a more comprehensive approach to covering key technologies would enhance the learning experience."
outdated mongodb section and overall outdate course.you can still use this as a guide by reading new documentation for the respective tech and looking at new comments can help you find solution,"The reviewer felt that certain sections, particularly the MongoDB section, were outdated and no longer relevant, making it challenging to apply the information in a modern context. However, they suggested that students could still leverage the course by referring to updated documentation and seeking guidance from online communities for solutions."

They eagerly anticipated future courses from her, highlighting the instructor's exceptional ability to connect with students."
"The only thing i didn't like was that when i was doing this course all my technology versions were way ahead of what were used in this course and this lead to many many issues and problem. Even to some point that I had to leave that section and move forward. The most problematic sections were the website deploy, the crypto and the NFT ones.","Customer expressed frustration with the outdated technology versions used in the online course, leading to difficulties with certain sections like website deployment, cryptocurrency, and NFT topics. Despite this issue, they still managed to complete the course but were significantly impacted by their technical setup."
"Angela, you are so sweet and kind, but I was expecting a beginner friendly course. I hate the fact that we don't code along with you and I hate the fact that you expect us to solve an exercise before you showing us how to do it. It's like you expect a child to eat by himself, but he never was taught how...","Angela felt misled as a beginner-friendly course, citing frustrations with not coding along and expecting students to complete exercises without guidance. She expressed feeling helpless in learning due to the instructor's approach."
"It was really fun learning to be a web developer but I had a lot of problems, sometimes I didn't understand the programming logic and sometimes I felt frustrated because my program didn't work.

However, my experience took a nosedive once I reached Section 33, which focused on MongoDB.","Although the bootcamp was promising in its earlier sections, customer's enthusiasm waned with the introduction of MongoDB (Section 33), citing it as a point where their experience 'took a nosedive'. Overall, they expressed disappointment due to the decline in quality from Section 32 onwards."
"Angela Yu's full-stack web development course has its pros and cons. The HTML and CSS sections stand out for their clear explanations and thorough content coverage. However, the JavaScript portion, particularly the function section, falls short. Understanding how to return values can be challenging, and the examples provided may not always be helpful or relevant, leading to confusion instead of clarity.","Angela Yu's full-stack web development course offers strengths in HTML and CSS coverage, but struggles with JavaScript explanations that may leave students confused about returning values, hindering a smooth learning experience. Despite some areas for improvement, the overall assessment highlights a solid foundation for those willing to put in extra effort."

They express gratitude for taking the course and appreciation for Dr. Angela Yu's instruction."
"This is the worst course I have ever taken in my entire life. The videos are very old, there are no resources, some resources don't work anymore, and the websites it recommends no longer exist. As you watch videos, the instructor removes them randomly, and the videos are all messed up. This course is a total waste of time. There are so many better courses available for free.","The customer was extremely disappointed with the outdated content, lack of resources, technical issues, and unusable websites recommended in the course, making it a total waste of their time and a poor learning experience. They feel that there are much better online courses available for free."

The course covers a wide range of web development topics, providing a comprehensive and up-to-date curriculum and Dr Angelas Yus teaching style really encourages you to push forward. Will definitely come back and review.","This student is extremely satisfied with the course, praising its comprehensive coverage of web development topics and Dr Angela's engaging teaching style. They plan to return for future courses, indicating high levels of engagement and loyalty."
