review,summary
HTML and CSS if very nicely covered but later sections are recorded more than 4 years back and now each and everything has updated so much that it became a pathetic experience to follow this course. This course should be updated totally or should not be named as web development bootcamp 2023?,"Although the early parts of the course covering HTML and CSS were well-done, the outdated content in later sections made the student find the rest of the material inaccessible due to rapid advancements in web development. The customer recommends either a complete overhaul or rebranding of the course as Web Development Bootcamp 2023."
"Initially, I rated this course 5 stars and EVERYTHING was indeed 5 stars till authentication module where everythig was outdated and I thought it's just Authentication module and that's it BUT then React module came after where everything is so outdated that you cannot do a single thing from video without getting an error that says that way of doing it is outdated and no longer supported. I remember from Angela video that she once said that we should rethink twice before buying an outdated udemy course..Huge dissapointment at the end because I could not get a single full project from this course without not watching 8+ hours youtube tutorials to cover the holes from this course...","The customer's initial enthusiasm for the course was dampened when they encountered outdated content and errors in both the authentication and React modules, leading to frustration and disappointment with the overall experience."
"Best course ever for web development. No one can match the level of her efforts that she put in making this course. After completion of this course , you will be capable for freelancing. She taught the front end and back end very well. The best thing about this course is that she keep updating the course time to time.","The customer thoroughly enjoyed the online course, praising its instructor's exceptional efforts and comprehensive coverage of both front-end and back-end web development topics. They appreciated the continuous updates to the course, feeling it has equipped them with the skills necessary for freelancing success."
"The course is good ! BUT I think when teaching everything together is best than separate topics , example creating projects that uses all tecnologies in one project its hard to get on beginning but good to have every thing in a same project , a project like Social Network would be great , I dont know if it exists in the next lessons , but so far has been good , Thanks","The customer found the course to be good overall, but suggested that teaching each technology separately might have been more effective for beginners, particularly when building complex projects like a social network. Despite this critique, they appreciated the pace of the course so far."
"just a average course, she just ask you to read other documentation for even basic concepts and because other documentation aren't for beginners, you need external sources like other youtube channels to understand. there is room for lots of improvement in the course.","This customer found the online course to be average in quality, with frustration arising from needing to consult additional resources due to insufficient foundational explanations within the course itself."
"I completed a web development bootcamp and it was an amazing experience. The instructors were knowledgeable, the curriculum was well-structured. Highly recommend it to anyone looking to get into web development.","Student had a highly positive experience with the web development bootcamp, citing knowledgeable instructors and a well-structured curriculum as key strengths that made their learning journey successful."
"This course is best for beginners who want to know the basics of web designing. It may not have some advanced topics that are not necessary for understanding basics. My only suggestion is certification is only provided for completed full courses, I requested the Author provide different types of certificates for front-end, back-end and full-stack. It will also help to attract more students, that's my humble request thankyou.","A beginner-friendly course covering web design basics, but lacking advanced topics and certification options. The author should consider offering separate certifications for front-end, back-end, and full-stack development to cater to a broader range of learners."
"This course has been amazing for me to learn the fundamentals and I think it has been designed in a way for us to get stuck , read a few doc , try to figure it out and move on . Great Job !!","The customer found this online course 'amazing' as it effectively taught them the fundamentals through an engaging approach that encouraged self-learning and exploration. They praised the course's design, which allowed for a hands-on experience by having students read materials, try to figure things out on their own before moving forward."
Angela has been helping me to get to my educational goals. Having a outstanding teacher has helped me be successful in all of my current projects in her corse.

"before taking this course i was a studying coding just by finding long hours YouTube videos and others. but this course was a hidden Jem for me now i found it. it is concise and to the point above all it is time saver. thank you, Angela, for making this course, wish you best of luck in your endeavors!!!","Angela's course provided a condensed and efficient learning experience, saving student Angela hours of searching YouTube videos, and she highly recommends it for its concise and effective approach."
Angela's course is great and is fun to follow along. I can't provide a perfect score simply because some of the more important parts on the backend segment are outdated. Though I guess some would argue that the struggle to figure out the proper solution is part of the learning process. (It was stressful nonetheless),"Angela's course is engaging and enjoyable to follow, but has some limitations with outdated information in the backend segments, which can be frustrating for learners. The overall experience is great, despite some technical challenges that require patience and perseverance."
I am a manager working to refresh my knowledge and get back into hands-on development. This course has been amazing in how it is structured and how it guides me through concepts. This is what I needed and more.,"The instructor's structured approach to teaching concepts was invaluable for this manager looking to refresh their knowledge and return to hands-on development, exceeding their expectations and providing a comprehensive learning experience.

"Pretty easy to understand they the teacher explains everything, even if you are a complete beginner, this is all you need to go from basic to intermediate, then, of course, you need to figure out how to become a better programmer.","This reviewer found the course to be accessible and easy to follow, thanks to the teacher's clear explanations, making it an ideal starting point for complete beginners looking to improve their programming skills from basic to intermediate levels."
"She is an amazing teacher! Angela's teaching is outstanding. It's easy to understand, her pronunciation is clear, and even though English isn't my native language, I can follow along easily.

They highly recommend her lectures, citing her valuable tips and motivational words as key strengths."
"For this price, it is an amazing course. It covers a wide range of programming knowledge, including GIT, CSS, JS, Node, DB, API, React, JQuery,  Web 3 and etc. The React section is a bit outdated, but the explanations are perfect! I have access to the Laracast platform, and I can make comparisons. In my opinion, Angela has created good practices and provided valuable resources for developers. It's a good starting point. However, I need new knowledge about the latest React 18 and a deeper dive into hooks, etc.","Customer finds the course to be an excellent value for its price, covering a broad range of programming topics but notes that some sections, like React, may benefit from updates to reflect current best practices. Overall, they appreciate Angela's teaching style and resources, but seek further exploration of newer technologies like React 18 and advanced hooks."
"There is a big mismatch and midway updates in some of the course contents . Meanwhile you replaced the section of Mongoose DB with a new section for Postgres DB,  the subsequent sections are talking heavily about the usage of Mongoose. Not Only that but Mongoose is kept as a main part of code structure in Authentication and Security Section and left us suffering either skip this part or searching for proper solutions.","Customers feel frustrated with course updates, specifically the mismatch between the original content and new sections, which led to unnecessary learning of outdated concepts (e.g., Mongoose DB) rather than focusing on more relevant Postgres DB topics. They express confusion with the continued emphasis on Mongoose in later sections, particularly in Authentication and Security."
"She is very good at creating the course, but at this point of time (sept 2023) i am unable to follow her videos as she just went and deleted obsolete videos and didnt warn or do anything then she post a seperate link for old video, but after deleting the videos she didt post the new video in their place, there are few new videos , but you cant understand them if havenot studied the old videos , so basically if you wish to follow this couse you need to first study old course the start new couse , so basically this new course is forcefully inserted , angela you should have posted a new course with updated video and just sell it at a lowest price","Customer feels frustrated with the update to the course, citing difficulties in following new videos due to deletion of older ones without warning or alternative guidance. They believe the new content is insufficient to stand alone and recommend a revised approach, such as offering updated videos at a lower price rather than releasing them as an entirely new course."
"Very very well structured, and the best thing to me in this course is it's not about only learning web development from scratch and knowing the industry used jargons and best practices, but this course also teaches you to learn almost anything and many other useful stuffs. Lots of love for the instructor Dr. Angela Yu.","This customer praises the well-structured nature of the course and appreciates its comprehensive approach that extends beyond web development skills, teaching valuable skills for learning any subject. They also express admiration for Instructor Dr. Angela Yu's teaching style."
"I started this course a month ago. I found this interesting till the end of frontend module. As of now the backend modules are completely outdated. The frontend section is amazing as it's up to date. but the backend lectures are from 2018 and the technologies are changed. So, I request to check the course backend section at the time of your purchase. Again, if you want to become a frontend developer you can go for it. Please update the course as soon as possible.","The customer found the frontend module engaging but was disappointed with the outdated and archaic content in the backend modules, which were last updated in 2018. They recommend updating the course to reflect current technologies, particularly in the backend section."
"As a software professional on the embedded side that has wanting to make a jump to the web side, this is EXACTLY what I was looking for. With that being said, it starts off at a perfect pace for a beginner as well, with plenty of challenges along the way to test and refine knowledge as it's gained instead of hurrying off to the next topic.","The customer was highly satisfied with the online course, stating it meets their needs as a software professional looking to transition from embedded systems to web development, and praises its gentle pace and challenging content for effective learning."
"I recommend to take 100 days of code using Python then proceed to this bootcamp. Python will give you better understanding because of lesser code than Javascript. and also they have some same videos for basic HTML and some code, which is really good to think without looking at the solution. you can also see the difference when using else if statement.","Customer highly recommends taking the 100 Days of Code in Python course before this bootcamp, citing its ability to provide a solid foundation and better understanding due to its simplicity compared to JavaScript. They appreciate the practice exercises and feedback on coding concepts like `else if` statements."
"Really good course, you need to dig in on some documentation because the outdated data, but this helps to improve your skills on reading the documentation the proper way. 100% recommended.","This learner found the course to be a valuable investment in their skills, although noted that the outdated data requires additional research from external sources, recommending it for those willing to supplement with outside resources."

It's a very comprehensive course in terms of the topics covered. But I think the quality of the javascript section in this course is not upto the mark.

Promise API.,"The course covers a wide range of topics, but some customers felt that the JavaScript section fell short, missing key concepts like Promise API despite being comprehensive overall."
"The course has complicated topics in it, a few classes might be confusing, but overall Dr Angela explains things in a clear, concise manner, and she's always pushing people to keep going by the end of each module. Thoroughly recommend it.","Customer praises Dr. Angela for breaking down complex course topics into clear and concise explanations, while acknowledging some classes may require extra effort due to their intricacy. Overall, they highly recommend the course for its engaging format and supportive instructor."

I highly recommend this course to new beginners.","This customer praises the comprehensive and engaging online course taught by Angela, which provides detailed explanations of programming API topics, including both frontend and backend aspects, making it a worthwhile investment for new beginners."
Because it's very help full for me. When I start this course I just know about the HTML and CSS but letter on I got to much from this course. And it helps me to be the one in my life.

great course for intermediate programmers but not for beginner i guess cause some topics of advancejava script has OOPS concept that means the person who didnt know programming language before would not understand.,"This intermediate-level programmer found the course valuable, but noted its focus on advanced JavaScript concepts may limit accessibility to beginners without a prior programming background. Overall, they seemed satisfied with the content geared towards more experienced learners."

I recommend this course!","Students praised this online course for its clear structure and engaging hands-on activities that effectively taught them practical skills, making it a valuable and enjoyable learning experience."
"It's definitely challenging, but I'm able to understand and continue with the modules. I can't know for sure if I'll be able to successfully become a software engineer, but if I don't, it will be on me because the Instructor is teaching good, giving many examples and exercises. So far I'm happy with this course.","This customer found the course challenging but manageable, appreciating the instructor's clear explanations and example-driven approach. Despite acknowledging uncertainty about their future success as a software engineer, they remain satisfied with the course so far."
"Course is great and all explanations are clear. But there are several missed concepts. The React section don't cover everything like Router, useEffect and others. Even if they covered in Web3 section I think it would be better if it will be on React section too. In my opinion after this course not everyone will start carrer on Web3. It would be better if there are more big projects like building NFT Marketplace but combining React, PostgreSQL and NodeJS together. Some courses should be updated too but it is not big problem.","The customer praises the clarity of explanations in the course, but expresses frustration with gaps in coverage, particularly around key concepts in the React section. They suggest adding more comprehensive project examples to help solidify learning and improving existing content to better prepare students for a career in Web3."
outdated mongodb section and overall outdate course.you can still use this as a guide by reading new documentation for the respective tech and looking at new comments can help you find solution,"Customer found the MongoDB section to be outdated and the entire course lacking in relevance, but appreciated the flexibility of using newer documentation as a supplement to update their skills."
"I really loved this course. Angela's teaching style is very engaging, and it feels as though she is speaking directly to you at times.

Even to some point that I had to leave that section and move forward. The most problematic sections were the website deploy, the crypto and the NFT ones.","This customer found significant technical difficulties with the course material, specifically with outdated technology versions that caused problems during key sections such as website deployment, cryptocurrency, and NFT topics, leading to frustration and a need to skip ahead."
"Angela, you are so sweet and kind, but I was expecting a beginner friendly course. I hate the fact that we don't code along with you and I hate the fact that you expect us to solve an exercise before you showing us how to do it. It's like you expect a child to eat by himself, but he never was taught how...","Angela found the course challenging due to its pace and lack of interactive coding exercises, feeling that she wasn't prepared or supported in learning the material as a beginner."
"It was really fun learning to be a web developer but I had a lot of problems, sometimes I didn't understand the programming logic and sometimes I felt frustrated because my program didn't work.

Overall, they expressed high hopes for the course but had a declining experience after that point."
"Angela Yu's full-stack web development course has its pros and cons. The HTML and CSS sections stand out for their clear explanations and thorough content coverage. However, the JavaScript portion, particularly the function section, falls short. Understanding how to return values can be challenging, and the examples provided may not always be helpful or relevant, leading to confusion instead of clarity.","Angela Yu's full-stack web development course excels in HTML and CSS sections but falters with JavaScript, particularly its function section, where unclear explanations and irrelevant examples can lead to confusion.

Customer sentiment: Extremely positive, enthusiastic, and grateful."
"This is the worst course I have ever taken in my entire life. The videos are very old, there are no resources, some resources don't work anymore, and the websites it recommends no longer exist.

There are so many better courses available for free.","This customer had a overwhelmingly negative experience with the course, citing outdated and non-functional resources, poor video quality, and a lack of support, which they felt made it a complete waste of their time.
