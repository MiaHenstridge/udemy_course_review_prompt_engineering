review,summary
HTML and CSS if very nicely covered but later sections are recorded more than 4 years back and now each and everything has updated so much that it became a pathetic experience to follow this course. This course should be updated totally or should not be named as web development bootcamp 2023?,"The review suggests the course content is outdated, making it an unsatisfactory learning experience for 2023, and questions its relevance in a modern web development bootcamp context."
"Initially, I rated this course 5 stars and EVERYTHING was indeed 5 stars till authentication module where everythig was outdated and I thought it's just Authentication module and that's it BUT then React module came after where everything is so outdated that you cannot do a single thing from video without getting an error that says that way of doing it is outdated and no longer supported. I remember from Angela video that she once said that we should rethink twice before buying an outdated udemy course..Huge dissapointment at the end because I could not get a single full project from this course without not watching 8+ hours youtube tutorials to cover the holes from this course...","The review highlights disappointment due to outdated content in both authentication and React modules, making it difficult to complete projects without additional learning from YouTube tutorials."
"Best course ever for web development. No one can match the level of her efforts that she put in making this course. After completion of this course , you will be capable for freelancing. She taught the front end and back end very well. The best thing about this course is that she keep updating the course time to time.","Highly praised course covering both frontend and backend web development; regularly updated by the instructor, offering prospects for freelancing after completion."
"The course is good ! BUT I think when teaching everything together is best than separate topics , example creating projects that uses all tecnologies in one project its hard to get on beginning but good to have every thing in a same project , a project like Social Network would be great , I dont know if it exists in the next lessons , but so far has been good , Thanks","The course is overall positive, but combining all topics into one project for better understanding is challenging. A social network project example is suggested and appreciated."
"just a average course, she just ask you to read other documentation for even basic concepts and because other documentation aren't for beginners, you need external sources like other youtube channels to understand. there is room for lots of improvement in the course.",The course lacks beginner-friendly documentation and requires external resources for understanding; significant improvements are needed.
"I completed a web development bootcamp and it was an amazing experience. The instructors were knowledgeable, the curriculum was well-structured. Highly recommend it to anyone looking to get into web development.","Positive review highlighting knowledgeable instructors, well-structured curriculum, and strong recommendation for web development bootcamp."
"This course is best for beginners who want to know the basics of web designing. It may not have some advanced topics that are not necessary for understanding basics. My only suggestion is certification is only provided for completed full courses, I requested the Author provide different types of certificates for front-end, back-end and full-stack. It will also help to attract more students, that's my humble request thankyou.","The course is ideal for beginners teaching basic web design but lacks advanced topics. The reviewer suggests offering separate certificates for front-end, back-end, and full-stack development to enhance student appeal."
"This course has been amazing for me to learn the fundamentals and I think it has been designed in a way for us to get stuck , read a few doc , try to figure it out and move on . Great Job !!","The course effectively covers the basics, challenges learners with problems that require reading and thinking to solve, and is praised for its design, making it both engaging and educational."
Angela has been helping me to get to my educational goals. Having a outstanding teacher has helped me be successful in all of my current projects in her corse. I really love how easy she has made accessing further help on every project & I can go on my own time.,"Angela is an outstanding tutor who helps me achieve my educational goals and makes it easy to access additional support for my projects, allowing me to learn at my own pace."
"This is the third course I have taken from Angela and it's as always highly interesting and project-oriented, if you want to gain leadership in the web realm just take the course and work hard. It's worth the money.","Angela's course is engaging, project-based, and effective for gaining leadership skills in web development; it's a worthwhile investment."
"before taking this course i was a studying coding just by finding long hours YouTube videos and others. but this course was a hidden Jem for me now i found it. it is concise and to the point above all it is time saver. thank you, Angela, for making this course, wish you best of luck in your endeavors!!!","Angela's coding course offers concise, efficient content that significantly improved my skills, making it a valuable resource and saving me time."
Angela's course is great and is fun to follow along. I can't provide a perfect score simply because some of the more important parts on the backend segment are outdated. Though I guess some would argue that the struggle to figure out the proper solution is part of the learning process. (It was stressful nonetheless),"Angela's course is enjoyable, but some backend content is outdated, and figuring out solutions can be a part of the learning experience, although it might be stressful; however, it's beneficial for growth."
I am a manager working to refresh my knowledge and get back into hands-on development. This course has been amazing in how it is structured and how it guides me through concepts. This is what I needed and more.,"The course was highly effective for refreshing managerial knowledge and gaining hands-on development skills, meeting the reviewer's specific needs."
"Pretty easy to understand they the teacher explains everything, even if you are a complete beginner, this is all you need to go from basic to intermediate, then, of course, you need to figure out how to become a better programmer.","The teacher is patient and covers all necessary topics from beginner to intermediate level, leaving learners to improve their programming skills independently."
"She is an amazing teacher! Angela's teaching is outstanding. It's easy to understand, her pronunciation is clear, and even though English isn't my native language, I can follow along easily. Her valuable tips and motivational words are a great help for my learning. I highly recommend her lectures.","Angela is an outstanding teacher with easy-to-understand lessons, clear pronunciation, and helpful tips that motivate learners. She strongly recommends her lectures."
"For this price, it is an amazing course. It covers a wide range of programming knowledge, including GIT, CSS, JS, Node, DB, API, React, JQuery,  Web 3 and etc. The React section is a bit outdated, but the explanations are perfect! I have access to the Laracast platform, and I can make comparisons. In my opinion, Angela has created good practices and provided valuable resources for developers. It's a good starting point. However, I need new knowledge about the latest React 18 and a deeper dive into hooks, etc.","An excellent course covering various programming topics, including modern technologies like React 18 and hooks, providing valuable resources for developers but suggesting further exploration into advanced React features."
"There is a big mismatch and midway updates in some of the course contents . Meanwhile you replaced the section of Mongoose DB with a new section for Postgres DB,  the subsequent sections are talking heavily about the usage of Mongoose. Not Only that but Mongoose is kept as a main part of code structure in Authentication and Security Section and left us suffering either skip this part or searching for proper solutions.","Course content has significant updates midway, replacing Mongoose DB with Postgres DB and emphasizing Mongoose usage, particularly affecting authentication and security sections."
"She is very good at creating the course, but at this point of time (sept 2023) i am unable to follow her videos as she just went and deleted obsolete videos and didnt warn or do anything then she post a seperate link for old video, but after deleting the videos she didt post the new video in their place, there are few new videos , but you cant understand them if havenot studied the old videos , so basically if you wish to follow this couse you need to first study old course the start new couse , so basically this new course is forcefully inserted , angela you should have posted a new course with updated video and just sell it at a lowest price","The review expresses disappointment due to the deletion of previous videos without warning, creating gaps in learning. It advises following old videos before starting new courses to maintain continuity, suggesting an outdated approach that fails to update content promptly."
"Very very well structured, and the best thing to me in this course is it's not about only learning web development from scratch and knowing the industry used jargons and best practices, but this course also teaches you to learn almost anything and many other useful stuffs. Lots of love for the instructor Dr. Angela Yu.","The course offers comprehensive web development skills along with general learning techniques, well-structured, and highly praises the instructor, Dr. Angela Yu."
"I started this course a month ago. I found this interesting till the end of frontend module. As of now the backend modules are completely outdated. The frontend section is amazing as it's up to date. but the backend lectures are from 2018 and the technologies are changed. So, I request to check the course backend section at the time of your purchase. Again, if you want to become a frontend developer you can go for it. Please update the course as soon as possible.",The review praises the frontend course content while noting outdated backend modules and suggesting an urgent need for updates. It also encourages focusing on frontend development if that's the target path and requests immediate backend content updates.
"As a software professional on the embedded side that has wanting to make a jump to the web side, this is EXACTLY what I was looking for. With that being said, it starts off at a perfect pace for a beginner as well, with plenty of challenges along the way to test and refine knowledge as it's gained instead of hurrying off to the next topic.","A great course for software professionals transitioning from embedded to web development, suitable for beginners with progressive challenges to reinforce learning."
"I recommend to take 100 days of code using Python then proceed to this bootcamp. Python will give you better understanding because of lesser code than Javascript. and also they have some same videos for basic HTML and some code, which is really good to think without looking at the solution. you can also see the difference when using else if statement.","Take Python for a solid foundation before this bootcamp; it offers insightful video comparisons with basic HTML and showcases the effectiveness of nested if statements, enhancing problem-solving skills."
"Really good course, you need to dig in on some documentation because the outdated data, but this helps to improve your skills on reading the documentation the proper way. 100% recommended.",A great course with valuable documentation insights; highly recommended for improving skills in reading and understanding documentation properly.
"Not only is a very complete course, the way is explanined is so fun, didactic and detailed. No extra music on the background, a pleasant voice pitch and the diction of the teacher is just perfect.","The course is comprehensive and engaging, with an enjoyable, informative presentation, clear audio, and perfect diction from the instructor."
Angela has so much enthusiasm and it comes across in everything she says. Content is very interesting and informative - need to move on to the next lesson as soon as the last one has finished.,"Angela is enthusiastic and engaging, making her lessons both interesting and informative, encouraging prompt continuation after each session."
It's a very comprehensive course in terms of the topics covered. But I think the quality of the javascript section in this course is not upto the mark. There are lots of think which are important but are not covered eg. Promise API.,"The course covers comprehensive topics, particularly strong in HTML and CSS, but lacks depth in JavaScript, notably missing important topics like Promise API."
"The course has complicated topics in it, a few classes might be confusing, but overall Dr Angela explains things in a clear, concise manner, and she's always pushing people to keep going by the end of each module. Thoroughly recommend it.","The course covers complex topics, may seem confusing occasionally, but Dr. Angela explains clearly and persistently encourages students through modules, making it a thorough recommendation."

I highly recommend this course to new beginners.","The course is worth buying due to Angela's detailed explanations on API topics, engaging teaching style, and helpful ads, making it ideal for newcomers struggling with programming APIs."
Because it's very help full for me. When I start this course I just know about the HTML and CSS but letter on I got to much from this course. And it helps me to be the one in my life. I just start but now I can do much more in my Web career. And I give four star because of one or two module are not completely update.,"The review highlights that the course significantly enhanced the reviewer's HTML and CSS knowledge, leading to substantial improvements in their web career. They gave a four-star rating due to outdated modules."
"Awesome course! Everything is expressed an explained straight to the point.

"Everything is awesome, but as a mobile user I'm unable to do coding exercises, if there is anything that mobile users install and do coding exercises, please do mention it,it will help a lot.","Great overall experience, but lacks mobile-specific coding app recommendations for practical learning."
great course for intermediate programmers but not for beginner i guess cause some topics of advancejava script has OOPS concept that means the person who didnt know programming language before would not understand.,"An excellent course for intermediate Java developers, but may be challenging for beginners due to advanced topics without a strong foundation in programming concepts like OOP."

I recommend this course!","The course is well-structured and practical, making it highly valuable and recommended for learners who enjoy hands-on application creation."
"It's definitely challenging, but I'm able to understand and continue with the modules. I can't know for sure if I'll be able to successfully become a software engineer, but if I don't, it will be on me because the Instructor is teaching good, giving many examples and exercises. So far I'm happy with this course.","The course is challenging but manageable, with a supportive instructor who provides ample examples and exercises. Overall satisfaction is reported by the reviewer, though uncertainty remains about becoming a software engineer due to personal reasons."
"Course is great and all explanations are clear. But there are several missed concepts. The React section don't cover everything like Router, useEffect and others. Even if they covered in Web3 section I think it would be better if it will be on React section too. In my opinion after this course not everyone will start carrer on Web3. It would be better if there are more big projects like building NFT Marketplace but combining React, PostgreSQL and NodeJS together. Some courses should be updated too but it is not big problem.","Course is good with clear explanations, but lacks comprehensive coverage of certain React concepts and doesn't foster a career in Web3; better projects combining various technologies would enhance learning."
outdated mongodb section and overall outdate course.you can still use this as a guide by reading new documentation for the respective tech and looking at new comments can help you find solution,"The MongoDB and overall course sections are outdated, but useful as a starting point for new documentation exploration and community feedback."
"I really loved this course. Angela's teaching style is very engaging, and it feels as though she is speaking directly to you at times.

I very much enjoyed this course, and I hope that she teaches courses on other development technologies soon.","Enrolled in a course taught by Angela, who is engaging and explains concepts well with challenges for practice. Highly enjoyed the course and hopes to see her teach more about different development technologies in the future."
"The only thing i didn't like was that when i was doing this course all my technology versions were way ahead of what were used in this course and this lead to many many issues and problem. Even to some point that I had to leave that section and move forward. The most problematic sections were the website deploy, the crypto and the NFT ones.","The review highlights frustration with outdated technology compared to the course requirements, causing numerous issues, particularly in web deployment, cryptography, and NFTs sections, prompting the reviewer to skip these parts."
"Angela, you are so sweet and kind, but I was expecting a beginner friendly course. I hate the fact that we don't code along with you and I hate the fact that you expect us to solve an exercise before you showing us how to do it. It's like you expect a child to eat by himself, but he never was taught how...",The course provided was not beginner-friendly and lacks guidance in solving exercises before teaching.
"It was really fun learning to be a web developer but I had a lot of problems, sometimes I didn't understand the programming logic and sometimes I felt frustrated because my program didn't work. So I really repeated a lot of explanations so it could be said that my progress was not that fast. However, I felt this was the challenge and I continued to progress and learn until I became a junior web developer in the future.","Learning web development was challenging due to programming logic issues and frustration with non-working programs, but it was an essential experience for becoming a junior web developer."

However, my experience took a nosedive once I reached Section 33, which focused on MongoDB.",Enrolled in Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp hoping for quality learning but found the course lacking after reaching MongoDB content in Section 33.
"Angela Yu's full-stack web development course has its pros and cons. The HTML and CSS sections stand out for their clear explanations and thorough content coverage.

Thank you, Dr. Angela Yu and Greetings from Egypt, :).",Enables learners to become web developers through a supportive and engaging bootcamp offered by Dr. Angela Yu from Egypt; grateful for the experience and instructor's kindness.
"This is the worst course I have ever taken in my entire life. The videos are very old, there are no resources, some resources don't work anymore, and the websites it recommends no longer exist. As you watch videos, the instructor removes them randomly, and the videos are all messed up. This course is a total waste of time. There are so many better courses available for free.","The course is outdated, lacks resources, and suffers from broken videos with non-existent websites, making it an inefficient use of time compared to other free alternatives."
