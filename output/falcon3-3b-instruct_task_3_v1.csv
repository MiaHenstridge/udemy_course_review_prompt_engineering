review,summary
HTML and CSS if very nicely covered but later sections are recorded more than 4 years back and now each and everything has updated so much that it became a pathetic experience to follow this course. This course should be updated totally or should not be named as web development bootcamp 2023?,"The HTML and CSS were well-covered, but the older content makes revisiting the course a frustrating experience due to significant updates since its initial release. It raises questions about course relevance for a 2023 web development bootcamp."
"Initially, I rated this course 5 stars and EVERYTHING was indeed 5 stars till authentication module where everythig was outdated and I thought it's just Authentication module and that's it BUT then React module came after where everything is so outdated that you cannot do a single thing from video without getting an error that says that way of doing it is outdated and no longer supported. I remember from Angela video that she once said that we should rethink twice before buying an outdated udemy course..Huge dissapointment at the end because I could not get a single full project from this course without not watching 8+ hours youtube tutorials to cover the holes from this course...",Disappointed by outdated content and requiring extensive additional learning; strongly advises reconsidering purchase of such courses.
"Best course ever for web development. No one can match the level of her efforts that she put in making this course. After completion of this course , you will be capable for freelancing. She taught the front end and back end very well. The best thing about this course is that she keep updating the course time to time.","An exceptional web development course offered by a dedicated instructor who keeps content updated, teaching both frontend and backend skills effectively, suitable for aspiring freelancers."
"The course is good ! BUT I think when teaching everything together is best than separate topics , example creating projects that uses all tecnologies in one project its hard to get on beginning but good to have every thing in a same project , a project like Social Network would be great , I dont know if it exists in the next lessons , but so far has been good , Thanks","The course is good, but teaching all topics together in a single project is challenging yet beneficial. An example like a social network project showcases skills across technologies. Overall, it's satisfactory so far."
"just a average course, she just ask you to read other documentation for even basic concepts and because other documentation aren't for beginners, you need external sources like other youtube channels to understand. there is room for lots of improvement in the course.","The course is average, with insufficient beginner-friendly documentation; significant improvements are needed."
"I completed a web development bootcamp and it was an amazing experience. The instructors were knowledgeable, the curriculum was well-structured. Highly recommend it to anyone looking to get into web development.","A fantastic web development bootcamp with knowledgeable instructors and well-structured curriculum, highly recommended for aspiring web developers."
"This course is best for beginners who want to know the basics of web designing. It may not have some advanced topics that are not necessary for understanding basics. My only suggestion is certification is only provided for completed full courses, I requested the Author provide different types of certificates for front-end, back-end and full-stack. It will also help to attract more students, that's my humble request thankyou.","The course is ideal for beginners looking to understand web design basics. There are no advanced topics covered, which may be limiting for those interested in specific areas like front-end, back-end, or full-stack development. Encouraging different certification types could attract more students. Thanks from the reviewer."
"This course has been amazing for me to learn the fundamentals and I think it has been designed in a way for us to get stuck , read a few doc , try to figure it out and move on . Great Job !!","The course is great because it allows learners to encounter challenges, read documentation, and attempt solutions before moving on, promoting self-learning."
Angela has been helping me to get to my educational goals. Having a outstanding teacher has helped me be successful in all of my current projects in her corse. I really love how easy she has made accessing further help on every project & I can go on my own time.,"Angela has been an outstanding and supportive teacher, making it easy for me to access help and work independently towards my educational goals."
"This is the third course I have taken from Angela and it's as always highly interesting and project-oriented, if you want to gain leadership in the web realm just take the course and work hard. It's worth the money.","Angela provides engaging, project-based courses focused on gaining leadership skills in web development, which are both worthwhile and affordable."
"before taking this course i was a studying coding just by finding long hours YouTube videos and others. but this course was a hidden Jem for me now i found it. it is concise and to the point above all it is time saver. thank you, Angela, for making this course, wish you best of luck in your endeavors!!!","Angela's coding course offers valuable insights and saves time, helping me improve my skills significantly."
Angela's course is great and is fun to follow along. I can't provide a perfect score simply because some of the more important parts on the backend segment are outdated. Though I guess some would argue that the struggle to figure out the proper solution is part of the learning process. (It was stressful nonetheless),"Angela's course is enjoyable but has outdated content, making it challenging for learners, who may argue that these difficulties contribute to the learning experience; however, it can be stressful."
I am a manager working to refresh my knowledge and get back into hands-on development. This course has been amazing in how it is structured and how it guides me through concepts. This is what I needed and more.,"The course effectively refreshes the manager's knowledge and skills, offering comprehensive guidance and necessary resources for hands-on development."
"Pretty easy to understand they the teacher explains everything, even if you are a complete beginner, this is all you need to go from basic to intermediate, then, of course, you need to figure out how to become a better programmer.","The teacher is patient and covers concepts thoroughly, guiding learners from beginner to intermediate levels, with the ultimate aim of improving programming skills."
"She is an amazing teacher! Angela's teaching is outstanding. It's easy to understand, her pronunciation is clear, and even though English isn't my native language, I can follow along easily. Her valuable tips and motivational words are a great help for my learning. I highly recommend her lectures.","Angela's teaching is excellent, easy to understand, clear pronunciation, motivational, and helpful with valuable tips; she is recommended."
"For this price, it is an amazing course. It covers a wide range of programming knowledge, including GIT, CSS, JS, Node, DB, API, React, JQuery,  Web 3 and etc. The React section is a bit outdated, but the explanations are perfect! I have access to the Laracast platform, and I can make comparisons. In my opinion, Angela has created good practices and provided valuable resources for developers. It's a good starting point. However, I need new knowledge about the latest React 18 and a deeper dive into hooks, etc.","A comprehensive course covering various programming skills at an affordable price, with potential updates needed for newer technologies like React 18 and a deeper understanding of hooks."
"There is a big mismatch and midway updates in some of the course contents . Meanwhile you replaced the section of Mongoose DB with a new section for Postgres DB,  the subsequent sections are talking heavily about the usage of Mongoose. Not Only that but Mongoose is kept as a main part of code structure in Authentication and Security Section and left us suffering either skip this part or searching for proper solutions.","Course content contains significant mismatches, especially after an update where Mongoose DB was replaced with Postgres DB, causing sections to focus excessively on Mongoose usage throughout the course."
"She is very good at creating the course, but at this point of time (sept 2023) i am unable to follow her videos as she just went and deleted obsolete videos and didnt warn or do anything then she post a seperate link for old video, but after deleting the videos she didt post the new video in their place, there are few new videos , but you cant understand them if havenot studied the old videos , so basically if you wish to follow this couse you need to first study old course the start new couse , so basically this new course is forcefully inserted , angela you should have posted a new course with updated video and just sell it at a lowest price","The course content has been abruptly changed with old videos deleted and new ones not posted. Students are encouraged to study the old content before starting the new course, making it essentially redundant. Angela should have updated her course with new videos instead of selling an incomplete offering at a lower price."
"Very very well structured, and the best thing to me in this course is it's not about only learning web development from scratch and knowing the industry used jargons and best practices, but this course also teaches you to learn almost anything and many other useful stuffs. Lots of love for the instructor Dr. Angela Yu.","The course offers valuable skills beyond web development, including learning almost anything, thanks to the insightful instructor, Dr. Angela Yu."
"I started this course a month ago. I found this interesting till the end of frontend module. As of now the backend modules are completely outdated. The frontend section is amazing as it's up to date. but the backend lectures are from 2018 and the technologies are changed. So, I request to check the course backend section at the time of your purchase. Again, if you want to become a frontend developer you can go for it. Please update the course as soon as possible.","The review highlights that the frontend is up-to-date while the backend content is outdated from 2018, featuring changed technologies and necessitating updates to align with current practices. It's suggested for potential learners to focus on the frontend module and request course improvements in the backend area for a more relevant learning experience."
"As a software professional on the embedded side that has wanting to make a jump to the web side, this is EXACTLY what I was looking for. With that being said, it starts off at a perfect pace for a beginner as well, with plenty of challenges along the way to test and refine knowledge as it's gained instead of hurrying off to the next topic.","The course is ideal for beginners, providing a balanced pace that includes both foundational learning and practical challenges to reinforce understanding, making it suitable for someone transitioning from embedded software to web development."
"I recommend to take 100 days of code using Python then proceed to this bootcamp. Python will give you better understanding because of lesser code than Javascript. and also they have some same videos for basic HTML and some code, which is really good to think without looking at the solution. you can also see the difference when using else if statement.","The review recommends taking a 100-day Python course, suggesting it's easier than JavaScript due to less code, and offers valuable lessons on HTML basics and conditional statements through comparative analysis with other resources."
"Really good course, you need to dig in on some documentation because the outdated data, but this helps to improve your skills on reading the documentation the proper way. 100% recommended.","An excellent course with valuable insights from documenting properly, despite outdated information; highly recommended by the reviewer."
"Not only is a very complete course, the way is explanined is so fun, didactic and detailed. No extra music on the background, a pleasant voice pitch and the diction of the teacher is just perfect.","The course is comprehensive, engagingly explained with no distracting background music, offering a pleasant listening experience through the teacher's clear voice."
Angela has so much enthusiasm and it comes across in everything she says. Content is very interesting and informative - need to move on to the next lesson as soon as the last one has finished.,"Angela is enthusiastic, making her lessons engaging and informative, prompting viewers to move on after each session."
It's a very comprehensive course in terms of the topics covered. But I think the quality of the javascript section in this course is not upto the mark. There are lots of think which are important but are not covered eg. Promise API.,"The course covers a wide range of JavaScript topics but lacks depth in the JavaScript section, notably missing important concepts like Promise API."
"The course has complicated topics in it, a few classes might be confusing, but overall Dr Angela explains things in a clear, concise manner, and she's always pushing people to keep going by the end of each module. Thoroughly recommend it.","The course covers complex topics with some confusion but is generally well-explained by Dr. Angela, who motivates students to continue through each module.

"This being my first web development course, I felt a tremendous sense of accomplishment upon completing it, and I attribute this success to Angela Yu's exceptional teaching. While this course may not make you a fully-fledged developer, it certainly motivates you to explore further and equips you with valuable insights on how to learn, apply your knowledge, and identify areas for growth. It serves as an excellent introduction to the vast world of web development. Admittedly, the course content is somewhat outdated, necessitating the use of additional resources. Nevertheless, considering its price, this course is an absolute gem. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Angela for her mentorship and the impressive way she delivers her lessons.","Completing a web development course led to significant satisfaction and growth, mainly due to Angela Yu's teaching. Though content is somewhat outdated, it offers valuable insights and serves as an excellent introduction, despite needing additional resources. The course is highly valued for its quality and price."
"It's definitely worth it to buy this course. Specially i was struggling one of the important topics in programming API that Angela deep dive into this field. She taught both frontend and backend topics detailed, subtitle is clear. Teaching process is fun, Angela's advertisement is valuable at the end of each section and keep motivate me. I highly recommend this course to new beginners.","The course is valuable, especially for understanding APIs taught by Angela in both frontend and backend with clear subtitles and engaging teaching. It's recommended for new learners."
Because it's very help full for me. When I start this course I just know about the HTML and CSS but letter on I got to much from this course. And it helps me to be the one in my life. I just start but now I can do much more in my Web career. And I give four star because of one or two module are not completely update.,"The course was very helpful, significantly improving my HTML and CSS skills and boosting my confidence for a better web career. I gave it four stars due to minor updates in some modules."
"Awesome course! Everything is expressed an explained straight to the point. I come from learning how to code from books which gives a deeper understanding, I wish that I started out with her videos to save time. I moved from books to this course for the exercises, quizzes and projects to make sure that I utilize, practice, and retain the material.","An excellent course that efficiently imparts knowledge through direct explanations and practical exercises, making it preferable to prior reading-based learning for hands-on practice and retention."
After completing this course I feel confident. After lots of ups and down finally I completed this course. Thanks to you for this wonderful course and I hope that you always brings new things.

Thank you, Angela and her team, for making my dream to become a developer possible! <3",Angela and her team made a developer's dream come true with engaging and realistic projects; highly praises her teaching and speaking abilities.
"Everything is awesome, but as a mobile user I'm unable to do coding exercises, if there is anything that mobile users install and do coding exercises, please do mention it,it will help a lot.","Everything great about the app, but lacks mobile-based coding exercise options for users; any recommendations would be greatly appreciated."
great course for intermediate programmers but not for beginner i guess cause some topics of advancejava script has OOPS concept that means the person who didnt know programming language before would not understand.,"A great course for intermediate programmers, but may be challenging for beginners due to advanced concepts like OOP in Java Script."
"An impressive course! It is very well structured, concise and very useful due to the practical part that requires the student's involvement in creating applications. I recommend this course!","The course is well-structured, practical, and includes student application creation, making it highly recommended."
"It's definitely challenging, but I'm able to understand and continue with the modules. I can't know for sure if I'll be able to successfully become a software engineer, but if I don't, it will be on me because the Instructor is teaching good, giving many examples and exercises. So far I'm happy with this course.","The course is challenging but manageable, with a supportive instructor who provides valuable examples and exercises. Overall satisfaction noted by the reviewer."
"Course is great and all explanations are clear. But there are several missed concepts. The React section don't cover everything like Router, useEffect and others. Even if they covered in Web3 section I think it would be better if it will be on React section too. In my opinion after this course not everyone will start carrer on Web3. It would be better if there are more big projects like building NFT Marketplace but combining React, PostgreSQL and NodeJS together. Some courses should be updated too but it is not big problem.","The course is excellent with clear explanations, but some missed concepts and insufficient coverage of advanced topics like Router and useEffect in the React section. It's uncertain whether this will lead to a career in Web3. A more comprehensive curriculum with large projects would be beneficial, especially if it integrates various technologies."
outdated mongodb section and overall outdate course.you can still use this as a guide by reading new documentation for the respective tech and looking at new comments can help you find solution,"The MongoDB section and the entire course are outdated, but they can serve as a starting point for learning if you consult new documentation and community discussions. Updates are recommended for a more current understanding."
"I really loved this course. Angela's teaching style is very engaging, and it feels as though she is speaking directly to you at times. She explains the concepts very well and provides challenges along the way to practice what you've just learned. I very much enjoyed this course, and I hope that she teaches courses on other development technologies soon.","Enrolled in a highly engaging course by Angela; excelled due to her direct teaching style, comprehensive explanations, and practical challenges. Excited for future topics in other development technologies."
"The only thing i didn't like was that when i was doing this course all my technology versions were way ahead of what were used in this course and this lead to many many issues and problem. Even to some point that I had to leave that section and move forward. The most problematic sections were the website deploy, the crypto and the NFT ones.","The review highlights frustration with outdated technology compared to course requirements, particularly impacting sections on website deployment, crypto, and NFTs."
"Angela, you are so sweet and kind, but I was expecting a beginner friendly course. I hate the fact that we don't code along with you and I hate the fact that you expect us to solve an exercise before you showing us how to do it. It's like you expect a child to eat by himself, but he never was taught how...","The course is sweet and kind-hearted but lacks beginner-friendliness and teaching style, making it difficult for learners to follow along."
"It was really fun learning to be a web developer but I had a lot of problems, sometimes I didn't understand the programming logic and sometimes I felt frustrated because my program didn't work. So I really repeated a lot of explanations so it could be said that my progress was not that fast. However, I felt this was the challenge and I continued to progress and learn until I became a junior web developer in the future.","Learning to be a web developer is challenging with frequent misunderstandings and frustrations, but it's rewarding for continuous learning and eventual advancement into junior roles."
"I recently completed Angela's course, and I must say it was an outstanding experience. The course was incredibly engaging and entertaining throughout. Angela's teaching style is not only informative but also very enjoyable.","Angela's course was engaging, entertaining, and highly enjoyable due to her informative and delightful teaching style."
"I enrolled in Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp 2023 with high hopes after completing the initial 32 sections, which were relatively up to date and well-structured. However, my experience took a nosedive once I reached Section 33, which focused on MongoDB.","Had high hopes for Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp 2023 but experienced a decline in learning effectiveness from Section 33 onwards, particularly with MongoDB content."
"Angela Yu's full-stack web development course has its pros and cons. The HTML and CSS sections stand out for their clear explanations and thorough content coverage. However, the JavaScript portion, particularly the function section, falls short. Understanding how to return values can be challenging, and the examples provided may not always be helpful or relevant, leading to confusion instead of clarity.","Angela Yu's web development course offers clear HTML/CSS explanations but struggles with JavaScript, especially when explaining value returns, potentially confusing learners."
"The best web development online bootcamp money can get, the instructor is great and friendly, the course is engaging overall I am so happy that I took this course. Thank you, Dr. Angela Yu and Greetings from Egypt, :).","Enthusiastic review of a web development online bootcamp, praising the instructor's friendliness and engagement, as well as expressing gratitude to Dr. Angela Yu and being from Egypt."
"This is the worst course I have ever taken in my entire life. The videos are very old, there are no resources, some resources don't work anymore, and the websites it recommends no longer exist. As you watch videos, the instructor removes them randomly, and the videos are all messed up. This course is a total waste of time. There are so many better courses available for free.","The course is outdated with broken resources and no current websites, making it a poor choice compared to other free options available."
"I am absolutely thrilled with this course! The course covers a wide range of web development topics, providing a comprehensive and up-to-date curriculum and Dr Angelas Yus teaching style really encourages you to push forward. Will definitely come back and review.","Enthusiastic Review: Comprehensive Curriculum, Engaging Teaching Style, Plans to Return for More Content."
