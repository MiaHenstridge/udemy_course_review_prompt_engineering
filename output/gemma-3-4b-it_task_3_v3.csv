review,summary
HTML and CSS if very nicely covered but later sections are recorded more than 4 years back and now each and everything has updated so much that it became a pathetic experience to follow this course. This course should be updated totally or should not be named as web development bootcamp 2023?,"The customer praised the strong initial coverage of HTML and CSS but found the outdated content, reflecting technologies from over four years ago, significantly hindered their learning experience and questioned the relevance of the course as a current web development bootcamp."
"Initially, I rated this course 5 stars and EVERYTHING was indeed 5 stars till authentication module where everythig was outdated and I thought it's just Authentication module and that's it BUT then React module came after where everything is so outdated that you cannot do a single thing from video without getting an error that says that way of doing it is outdated and no longer supported. I remember from Angela video that she once said that we should rethink twice before buying an outdated udemy course..Huge dissapointment at the end because I could not get a single full project from this course without not watching 8+ hours youtube tutorials to cover the holes from this course...","This customer initially praised the course but was deeply disappointed by outdated content, particularly in the React module, requiring extensive external resources to complete projects."
"Best course ever for web development. No one can match the level of her efforts that she put in making this course. After completion of this course , you will be capable for freelancing. She taught the front end and back end very well. The best thing about this course is that she keep updating the course time to time.","This customer raved about the course, praising the instructor's dedication and thoroughness in covering both front-end and back-end development, ultimately equipping students with skills for freelancing – a significant plus due to the instructor’s consistent updates."
"The course is good ! BUT I think when teaching everything together is best than separate topics , example creating projects that uses all tecnologies in one project its hard to get on beginning but good to have every thing in a same project , a project like Social Network would be great , I dont know if it exists in the next lessons , but so far has been good , Thanks","The customer appreciates the course's quality but suggests integrating topics into larger, more practical projects – particularly a comprehensive project like a social network – to improve initial understanding and engagement."
"just a average course, she just ask you to read other documentation for even basic concepts and because other documentation aren't for beginners, you need external sources like other youtube channels to understand. there is room for lots of improvement in the course.","The customer found the course adequate but lacking foundational explanations, relying heavily on external resources due to overly complex materials – offering significant room for improvement."
"I completed a web development bootcamp and it was an amazing experience. The instructors were knowledgeable, the curriculum was well-structured. Highly recommend it to anyone looking to get into web development.","This customer found the web development bootcamp incredibly valuable, praising its knowledgeable instructors and well-organized curriculum – making it a highly recommended program for aspiring developers."
"This course is best for beginners who want to know the basics of web designing. It may not have some advanced topics that are not necessary for understanding basics. My only suggestion is certification is only provided for completed full courses, I requested the Author provide different types of certificates for front-end, back-end and full-stack. It will also help to attract more students, that's my humble request thankyou.","The course provides a solid foundation in web design basics for beginners, but could benefit from offering tiered certifications to better recognize different skill levels."
"This course has been amazing for me to learn the fundamentals and I think it has been designed in a way for us to get stuck , read a few doc , try to figure it out and move on . Great Job !!","Customers find this course highly effective for learning foundational concepts through a challenging, hands-on approach that encourages independent problem-solving."
Angela has been helping me to get to my educational goals. Having a outstanding teacher has helped me be successful in all of my current projects in her corse. I really love how easy she has made accessing further help on every project & I can go on my own time.,"Angela is an exceptional instructor who effectively supports students in achieving their goals, particularly appreciating the ease of access to additional help and flexible learning schedule."
"This is the third course I have taken from Angela and it's as always highly interesting and project-oriented, if you want to gain leadership in the web realm just take the course and work hard. It's worth the money.",This customer found Angela’s courses consistently engaging and effective for developing leadership skills in web development through hands-on projects – a worthwhile investment.
"before taking this course i was a studying coding just by finding long hours YouTube videos and others. but this course was a hidden Jem for me now i found it. it is concise and to the point above all it is time saver. thank you, Angela, for making this course, wish you best of luck in your endeavors!!!","Angela loved this course for its concise and time-saving approach, which transformed her previously unstructured learning method into a focused and effective experience."
Angela's course is great and is fun to follow along. I can't provide a perfect score simply because some of the more important parts on the backend segment are outdated. Though I guess some would argue that the struggle to figure out the proper solution is part of the learning process. (It was stressful nonetheless),"Angela’s course offers an engaging and enjoyable learning experience, but it needs updating in its backend sections to remain relevant for learners."
I am a manager working to refresh my knowledge and get back into hands-on development. This course has been amazing in how it is structured and how it guides me through concepts. This is what I needed and more.,"This customer found the course exceptionally well-structured and guiding, perfectly aligning with their needs to refresh skills and return to hands-on development."
"Pretty easy to understand they the teacher explains everything, even if you are a complete beginner, this is all you need to go from basic to intermediate, then, of course, you need to figure out how to become a better programmer.","Customers found the course exceptionally clear and accessible, providing a solid foundation for beginners to progress to an intermediate level – however, they recognize further self-directed learning is needed to develop advanced programming skills."
"She is an amazing teacher! Angela's teaching is outstanding. It's easy to understand, her pronunciation is clear, and even though English isn't my native language, I can follow along easily. Her valuable tips and motivational words are a great help for my learning. I highly recommend her lectures.","The customer praised Angela as an outstanding teacher, highlighting her clarity, easy-to-understand explanations, and motivating approach – making the course accessible and effective for learners of all English levels."
"For this price, it is an amazing course. It covers a wide range of programming knowledge, including GIT, CSS, JS, Node, DB, API, React, JQuery,  Web 3 and etc. The React section is a bit outdated, but the explanations are perfect! I have access to the Laracast platform, and I can make comparisons. In my opinion, Angela has created good practices and provided valuable resources for developers. It's a good starting point. However, I need new knowledge about the latest React 18 and a deeper dive into hooks, etc.","This course offers an extensive overview of web development technologies and provides excellent foundational knowledge, though it could benefit from updated content on newer React versions."
"There is a big mismatch and midway updates in some of the course contents . Meanwhile you replaced the section of Mongoose DB with a new section for Postgres DB,  the subsequent sections are talking heavily about the usage of Mongoose. Not Only that but Mongoose is kept as a main part of code structure in Authentication and Security Section and left us suffering either skip this part or searching for proper solutions.","The customer experienced significant inconsistencies within the course content, particularly regarding database changes and the confusing integration of Mongoose despite its replacement with Postgres."
"She is very good at creating the course, but at this point of time (sept 2023) i am unable to follow her videos as she just went and deleted obsolete videos and didnt warn or do anything then she post a seperate link for old video, but after deleting the videos she didt post the new video in their place, there are few new videos , but you cant understand them if havenot studied the old videos , so basically if you wish to follow this couse you need to first study old course the start new couse , so basically this new course is forcefully inserted , angela you should have posted a new course with updated video and just sell it at a lowest price","The customer found the course creator skilled but frustrated by the disorganized transition, citing deleted videos and a confusing requirement to first study the old content before accessing the new material."
"Very very well structured, and the best thing to me in this course is it's not about only learning web development from scratch and knowing the industry used jargons and best practices, but this course also teaches you to learn almost anything and many other useful stuffs. Lots of love for the instructor Dr. Angela Yu.","This customer praised the course’s unique approach – not just teaching web development basics, but also equipping learners with valuable skills for continuous learning and broader industry knowledge, highlighting Dr. Angela Yu's excellent instruction."
"I started this course a month ago. I found this interesting till the end of frontend module. As of now the backend modules are completely outdated. The frontend section is amazing as it's up to date. but the backend lectures are from 2018 and the technologies are changed. So, I request to check the course backend section at the time of your purchase. Again, if you want to become a frontend developer you can go for it. Please update the course as soon as possible.",The customer praised the up-to-date frontend content but found the outdated backend modules (from 2018) significantly lacking and requested an update.
"As a software professional on the embedded side that has wanting to make a jump to the web side, this is EXACTLY what I was looking for. With that being said, it starts off at a perfect pace for a beginner as well, with plenty of challenges along the way to test and refine knowledge as it's gained instead of hurrying off to the next topic.","This course perfectly aligns with a software professional transitioning to web development, offering a well-paced learning experience with progressively challenging exercises."
"I recommend to take 100 days of code using Python then proceed to this bootcamp. Python will give you better understanding because of lesser code than Javascript. and also they have some same videos for basic HTML and some code, which is really good to think without looking at the solution. you can also see the difference when using else if statement.","The customer found value in starting with a 100-day Python course due to its simpler structure and helpful overlap with bootcamp content, particularly regarding conditional logic."
"Really good course, you need to dig in on some documentation because the outdated data, but this helps to improve your skills on reading the documentation the proper way. 100% recommended.","This course is highly recommended for improving documentation reading skills, though participants noted a need for more up-to-date materials."
"Not only is a very complete course, the way is explanined is so fun, didactic and detailed. No extra music on the background, a pleasant voice pitch and the diction of the teacher is just perfect.","This course receives high praise for its comprehensive content, engaging teaching style, and the instructor's clear and enjoyable delivery."
Angela has so much enthusiasm and it comes across in everything she says. Content is very interesting and informative - need to move on to the next lesson as soon as the last one has finished.,"Angela found the course incredibly engaging and informative, praising the content's interest and leading her to eagerly anticipate the next lesson."
It's a very comprehensive course in terms of the topics covered. But I think the quality of the javascript section in this course is not upto the mark. There are lots of think which are important but are not covered eg. Promise API.,"This course offers broad coverage of its subject matter, however, students found the JavaScript section lacking depth and missed key concepts like the Promise API."
"The course has complicated topics in it, a few classes might be confusing, but overall Dr Angela explains things in a clear, concise manner, and she's always pushing people to keep going by the end of each module. Thoroughly recommend it.","This course offers valuable insights into complex topics, thanks to Dr. Angela’s clear explanations and motivating approach – customers thoroughly recommend it despite some potentially confusing classes."
It was a really excellent course I learned a lot from it. Before taking this course I did not know anything about web development but after taking this course I can say that I am now web-developer,"This student found the course incredibly effective, transforming their complete lack of knowledge in web development into practical skills and confidence."
"This being my first web development course, I felt a tremendous sense of accomplishment upon completing it, and I attribute this success to Angela Yu's exceptional teaching. While this course may not make you a fully-fledged developer, it certainly motivates you to explore further and equips you with valuable insights on how to learn, apply your knowledge, and identify areas for growth. It serves as an excellent introduction to the vast world of web development. Admittedly, the course content is somewhat outdated, necessitating the use of additional resources. Nevertheless, considering its price, this course is an absolute gem. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Angela for her mentorship and the impressive way she delivers her lessons.","This customer found the course incredibly motivating and valuable as a beginner, praising Angela Yu's teaching style and recognizing it as a fantastic introduction to web development – despite needing supplemental resources."
"It's definitely worth it to buy this course. Specially i was struggling one of the important topics in programming API that Angela deep dive into this field. She taught both frontend and backend topics detailed, subtitle is clear. Teaching process is fun, Angela's advertisement is valuable at the end of each section and keep motivate me. I highly recommend this course to new beginners.","This customer found the course exceptionally valuable, particularly due to Angela’s thorough explanations of APIs and her engaging teaching style which motivated them as a beginner."
Because it's very help full for me. When I start this course I just know about the HTML and CSS but letter on I got to much from this course. And it helps me to be the one in my life. I just start but now I can do much more in my Web career. And I give four star because of one or two module are not completely update.,"This customer found the course incredibly helpful, significantly expanding their web development skills and boosting confidence in their career – though they noted a couple of modules could benefit from updates."
"Awesome course! Everything is expressed an explained straight to the point. I come from learning how to code from books which gives a deeper understanding, I wish that I started out with her videos to save time. I moved from books to this course for the exercises, quizzes and projects to make sure that I utilize, practice, and retain the material.","The customer found the course exceptionally clear and concise, appreciating its direct approach – they wish they’d started with the videos to accelerate their learning and now value the practical exercises and projects for solidifying their understanding."
After completing this course I feel confident. After lots of ups and down finally I completed this course. Thanks to you for this wonderful course and I hope that you always brings new things. This was very wonderful and knowledgeable journey.,"The customer felt a rewarding sense of accomplishment and confidence after completing the course, praising it as a valuable and engaging learning experience."
"Amazing! Angela is an awesome speaker/teacher and the projects in the course are really interesting and realistic. Thank you, Angela and her team, for making my dream to become a developer possible! <3","This student was thrilled with Angela’s engaging teaching style and practical, real-world project assignments, feeling empowered to pursue their goal of becoming a developer."
"Everything is awesome, but as a mobile user I'm unable to do coding exercises, if there is anything that mobile users install and do coding exercises, please do mention it,it will help a lot.","Customers find the course content excellent and engaging, however, mobile users are currently unable to complete the interactive coding exercises."
great course for intermediate programmers but not for beginner i guess cause some topics of advancejava script has OOPS concept that means the person who didnt know programming language before would not understand.,"This course is highly valuable for intermediate programmers seeking to deepen their JavaScript knowledge, particularly regarding OOP concepts, but may be challenging for those new to programming."
"An impressive course! It is very well structured, concise and very useful due to the practical part that requires the student's involvement in creating applications. I recommend this course!","This course receives high praise for its clear structure, practical application through hands-on project work, and overall usefulness."
"It's definitely challenging, but I'm able to understand and continue with the modules. I can't know for sure if I'll be able to successfully become a software engineer, but if I don't, it will be on me because the Instructor is teaching good, giving many examples and exercises. So far I'm happy with this course.","This customer finds the course challenging yet rewarding, praising the instructor’s clear explanations and plentiful practice materials – though success as a software engineer isn’t guaranteed."
"Course is great and all explanations are clear. But there are several missed concepts. The React section don't cover everything like Router, useEffect and others. Even if they covered in Web3 section I think it would be better if it will be on React section too. In my opinion after this course not everyone will start carrer on Web3. It would be better if there are more big projects like building NFT Marketplace but combining React, PostgreSQL and NodeJS together. Some courses should be updated too but it is not big problem.",The course offers clear explanations but needs significant expansion in key areas like React and broader project applications to truly prepare students for a career in Web3.
outdated mongodb section and overall outdate course.you can still use this as a guide by reading new documentation for the respective tech and looking at new comments can help you find solution,"The course felt outdated, particularly with its MongoDB content, but remains a useful reference point when supplemented with current documentation and newer resources."
"I really loved this course. Angela's teaching style is very engaging, and it feels as though she is speaking directly to you at times. She explains the concepts very well and provides challenges along the way to practice what you've just learned. I very much enjoyed this course, and I hope that she teaches courses on other development technologies soon.","Customers rave about Angela’s engaging teaching style and clear explanations, finding the course both challenging and rewarding."
"The only thing i didn't like was that when i was doing this course all my technology versions were way ahead of what were used in this course and this lead to many many issues and problem. Even to some point that I had to leave that section and move forward. The most problematic sections were the website deploy, the crypto and the NFT ones.","The customer found significant frustration with the course due to outdated technology versions, leading to technical difficulties and requiring them to skip key sections like website deployment and blockchain topics."
"Angela, you are so sweet and kind, but I was expecting a beginner friendly course. I hate the fact that we don't code along with you and I hate the fact that you expect us to solve an exercise before you showing us how to do it. It's like you expect a child to eat by himself, but he never was taught how...","Angela found the course lacking beginner-friendly support, particularly due to the absence of coding along and the expectation to complete exercises independently before instruction."
"It was really fun learning to be a web developer but I had a lot of problems, sometimes I didn't understand the programming logic and sometimes I felt frustrated because my program didn't work. So I really repeated a lot of explanations so it could be said that my progress was not that fast. However, I felt this was the challenge and I continued to progress and learn until I became a junior web developer in the future.","The customer found the course engaging and enjoyable but struggled with complex programming logic, leading to frustration and slower progress – ultimately fueling their determination to master the skills."
"I recently completed Angela's course, and I must say it was an outstanding experience. The course was incredibly engaging and entertaining throughout. Angela's teaching style is not only informative but also very enjoyable.",Customers found Angela’s course to be a highly engaging and enjoyable learning experience due to her informative and entertaining teaching style.
"I enrolled in Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp 2023 with high hopes after completing the initial 32 sections, which were relatively up to date and well-structured. However, my experience took a nosedive once I reached Section 33, which focused on MongoDB.","The course initially delivered valuable, well-structured content through Sections 1-32, but the student experienced a significant drop in satisfaction with the later MongoDB modules."
"Angela Yu's full-stack web development course has its pros and cons. The HTML and CSS sections stand out for their clear explanations and thorough content coverage. However, the JavaScript portion, particularly the function section, falls short. Understanding how to return values can be challenging, and the examples provided may not always be helpful or relevant, leading to confusion instead of clarity.",Students praise the course's strong HTML/CSS foundation but find the JavaScript – especially the function return value explanations – confusing and lacking practical relevance.
"The best web development online bootcamp money can get, the instructor is great and friendly, the course is engaging overall I am so happy that I took this course. Thank you, Dr. Angela Yu and Greetings from Egypt, :).","This customer highly recommends the course as the top web development bootcamp available, praising the engaging content and fantastic instructor, Dr. Angela Yu."
"This is the worst course I have ever taken in my entire life. The videos are very old, there are no resources, some resources don't work anymore, and the websites it recommends no longer exist. As you watch videos, the instructor removes them randomly, and the videos are all messed up. This course is a total waste of time. There are so many better courses available for free.","This customer found the online course deeply disappointing due to outdated content, broken resources, and technical issues, ultimately deeming it a complete waste of time."
"I am absolutely thrilled with this course! The course covers a wide range of web development topics, providing a comprehensive and up-to-date curriculum and Dr Angelas Yus teaching style really encourages you to push forward. Will definitely come back and review.","This customer was extremely satisfied with the course's comprehensive content and engaging teaching style by Dr. Angela Yus, expressing a strong intention to return for future reviews."
