review,summary
HTML and CSS if very nicely covered but later sections are recorded more than 4 years back and now each and everything has updated so much that it became a pathetic experience to follow this course. This course should be updated totally or should not be named as web development bootcamp 2023?,"This review criticizes the outdated content of the web development bootcamp, noting that materials are significantly behind current industry standards and making it a frustrating learning experience. The reviewer questions whether the course still deserves to be labeled as a 2023 program due to its lack of updated information."
"Initially, I rated this course 5 stars and EVERYTHING was indeed 5 stars till authentication module where everythig was outdated and I thought it's just Authentication module and that's it BUT then React module came after where everything is so outdated that you cannot do a single thing from video without getting an error that says that way of doing it is outdated and no longer supported. I remember from Angela video that she once said that we should rethink twice before buying an outdated udemy course..Huge dissapointment at the end because I could not get a single full project from this course without not watching 8+ hours youtube tutorials to cover the holes from this course...","The reviewer initially praised the course but was severely disappointed by its outdated content, particularly after the addition of the React module, requiring extensive external research to complete any projects. Ultimately, they found the course significantly lacking and unsupported compared to Angela's recommendations."
"Best course ever for web development. No one can match the level of her efforts that she put in making this course. After completion of this course , you will be capable for freelancing. She taught the front end and back end very well. The best thing about this course is that she keep updating the course time to time.","This web development course is highly praised for its comprehensive content, including both front-end and back-end instruction, and the instructor's dedicated efforts to constantly update the material.  Students completing the course will gain the skills needed for freelance work."
"The course is good ! BUT I think when teaching everything together is best than separate topics , example creating projects that uses all tecnologies in one project its hard to get on beginning but good to have every thing in a same project , a project like Social Network would be great , I dont know if it exists in the next lessons , but so far has been good , Thanks","The reviewer found the course valuable overall, but suggested integrating topics into larger projects like a social network to improve learning and comprehension, particularly at the beginning."
"just a average course, she just ask you to read other documentation for even basic concepts and because other documentation aren't for beginners, you need external sources like other youtube channels to understand. there is room for lots of improvement in the course.",This course is underwhelming as it primarily directs students to external resources like YouTube tutorials due to its lack of beginner-friendly explanations. The reviewer suggests significant improvements are needed to make the material more accessible.
"I completed a web development bootcamp and it was an amazing experience. The instructors were knowledgeable, the curriculum was well-structured. Highly recommend it to anyone looking to get into web development.",This web development bootcamp provided a fantastic learning experience with skilled instructors and a well-organized curriculum.  The reviewer highly recommends it for aspiring web developers.
"This course is best for beginners who want to know the basics of web designing. It may not have some advanced topics that are not necessary for understanding basics. My only suggestion is certification is only provided for completed full courses, I requested the Author provide different types of certificates for front-end, back-end and full-stack. It will also help to attract more students, that's my humble request thankyou.","This course effectively introduces web design fundamentals for beginners but lacks advanced content. The reviewer suggests offering tiered certifications (front-end, back-end, full-stack) to enhance student engagement and appeal."
"This course has been amazing for me to learn the fundamentals and I think it has been designed in a way for us to get stuck , read a few doc , try to figure it out and move on . Great Job !!","The reviewer found the course excellent for learning foundational concepts, praising its deliberate design that encourages problem-solving through documentation and independent exploration."
Angela has been helping me to get to my educational goals. Having a outstanding teacher has helped me be successful in all of my current projects in her corse. I really love how easy she has made accessing further help on every project & I can go on my own time.,"This student is extremely pleased with Angela's teaching, noting her significant impact on their academic success and the ease with which they can access support for projects at their convenience."
"This is the third course I have taken from Angela and it's as always highly interesting and project-oriented, if you want to gain leadership in the web realm just take the course and work hard. It's worth the money.","This reviewer enthusiastically recommends Angela’s courses, praising their engaging, project-based approach and effectiveness for developing leadership skills in web development. They believe the course is a worthwhile investment of time and money."
"before taking this course i was a studying coding just by finding long hours YouTube videos and others. but this course was a hidden Jem for me now i found it. it is concise and to the point above all it is time saver. thank you, Angela, for making this course, wish you best of luck in your endeavors!!!","Angela's course provided a focused and efficient learning experience, transforming the reviewer’s haphazard YouTube-based coding study into a streamlined and effective method. The reviewer enthusiastically praised the course as a ""hidden gem"" and a valuable time saver."
Angela's course is great and is fun to follow along. I can't provide a perfect score simply because some of the more important parts on the backend segment are outdated. Though I guess some would argue that the struggle to figure out the proper solution is part of the learning process. (It was stressful nonetheless),"The reviewer found Angela’s course engaging and enjoyable, but noted that the backend section contained outdated information which made it a challenging experience."
I am a manager working to refresh my knowledge and get back into hands-on development. This course has been amazing in how it is structured and how it guides me through concepts. This is what I needed and more.,"This reviewer, a manager returning to hands-on development, found the course exceptionally well-structured and effective in guiding them through key concepts. They felt it perfectly met their needs and exceeded expectations."
"Pretty easy to understand they the teacher explains everything, even if you are a complete beginner, this is all you need to go from basic to intermediate, then, of course, you need to figure out how to become a better programmer.","This resource provides a solid foundation for beginners in programming, guiding them from basic concepts to an intermediate level. However, the reviewer emphasizes that further self-directed learning is necessary to truly improve as a programmer."
"She is an amazing teacher! Angela's teaching is outstanding. It's easy to understand, her pronunciation is clear, and even though English isn't my native language, I can follow along easily. Her valuable tips and motivational words are a great help for my learning. I highly recommend her lectures.","This review praises Angela as an outstanding teacher who makes her lessons easy to understand and engaging, even for learners with limited English proficiency."
"For this price, it is an amazing course. It covers a wide range of programming knowledge, including GIT, CSS, JS, Node, DB, API, React, JQuery,  Web 3 and etc. The React section is a bit outdated, but the explanations are perfect! I have access to the Laracast platform, and I can make comparisons. In my opinion, Angela has created good practices and provided valuable resources for developers. It's a good starting point. However, I need new knowledge about the latest React 18 and a deeper dive into hooks, etc.","This course offers an extensive overview of modern web development technologies, with strong explanations and valuable resources – though some sections like React are slightly outdated.  It’s a great introductory resource but requires further study for the latest advancements in areas like React 18 and hooks."
"There is a big mismatch and midway updates in some of the course contents . Meanwhile you replaced the section of Mongoose DB with a new section for Postgres DB,  the subsequent sections are talking heavily about the usage of Mongoose. Not Only that but Mongoose is kept as a main part of code structure in Authentication and Security Section and left us suffering either skip this part or searching for proper solutions.","The course suffers from inconsistent content updates, notably switching database technologies mid-course and integrating Mongoose unexpectedly into authentication and security sections, causing confusion and requiring users to seek external solutions."
"She is very good at creating the course, but at this point of time (sept 2023) i am unable to follow her videos as she just went and deleted obsolete videos and didnt warn or do anything then she post a seperate link for old video, but after deleting the videos she didt post the new video in their place, there are few new videos , but you cant understand them if havenot studied the old videos , so basically if you wish to follow this couse you need to first study old course the start new couse , so basically this new course is forcefully inserted , angela you should have posted a new course with updated video and just sell it at a lowest price","The reviewer criticizes Angela for abruptly deleting older course videos without warning, creating a confusing situation where new content requires prior knowledge of the outdated material. They suggest she should have simply released an updated version of the course instead of this disruptive and disjointed approach."
"Very very well structured, and the best thing to me in this course is it's not about only learning web development from scratch and knowing the industry used jargons and best practices, but this course also teaches you to learn almost anything and many other useful stuffs. Lots of love for the instructor Dr. Angela Yu.","This course stands out for its comprehensive approach, teaching not just web development fundamentals but also valuable learning skills and industry knowledge. The reviewer particularly praised the instructor, Dr. Angela Yu, for her effective delivery."
"I started this course a month ago. I found this interesting till the end of frontend module. As of now the backend modules are completely outdated. The frontend section is amazing as it's up to date. but the backend lectures are from 2018 and the technologies are changed. So, I request to check the course backend section at the time of your purchase. Again, if you want to become a frontend developer you can go for it. Please update the course as soon as possible.","This review praises the updated frontend content but criticizes the outdated and obsolete backend modules, which are from 2018. The reviewer suggests potential buyers carefully check the backend section before purchasing and requests an urgent update to align with current technologies."
"As a software professional on the embedded side that has wanting to make a jump to the web side, this is EXACTLY what I was looking for. With that being said, it starts off at a perfect pace for a beginner as well, with plenty of challenges along the way to test and refine knowledge as it's gained instead of hurrying off to the next topic.","This review praises the course as an ideal starting point for embedded software professionals transitioning to web development, offering a well-paced curriculum with gradual challenges that build upon learned knowledge."
"I recommend to take 100 days of code using Python then proceed to this bootcamp. Python will give you better understanding because of lesser code than Javascript. and also they have some same videos for basic HTML and some code, which is really good to think without looking at the solution. you can also see the difference when using else if statement.","This reviewer suggests starting with 100 days of Python learning due to its simpler syntax compared to JavaScript, which will build a stronger foundational understanding. They particularly value the bootcamp's inclusion of basic HTML and problem-solving exercises that encourage independent thinking."
"Really good course, you need to dig in on some documentation because the outdated data, but this helps to improve your skills on reading the documentation the proper way. 100% recommended.","This course is highly recommended and offers valuable skill development in understanding technical documentation. However, users should be aware that the course relies on potentially outdated information."
"Not only is a very complete course, the way is explanined is so fun, didactic and detailed. No extra music on the background, a pleasant voice pitch and the diction of the teacher is just perfect.","This course receives high praise for its comprehensive content, engaging teaching style, and clear explanations. The reviewer particularly highlights the excellent delivery – a pleasant voice and precise diction – making it a truly enjoyable learning experience."
Angela has so much enthusiasm and it comes across in everything she says. Content is very interesting and informative - need to move on to the next lesson as soon as the last one has finished.,"This review praises the instructor, Angela, for her engaging and enthusiastic delivery of content that is both interesting and informative. The reviewer found the lessons so compelling they were eager to proceed to the next one immediately."
It's a very comprehensive course in terms of the topics covered. But I think the quality of the javascript section in this course is not upto the mark. There are lots of think which are important but are not covered eg. Promise API.,"This course offers broad coverage of many topics, however, the JavaScript section falls short and misses key concepts like the Promise API."
"The course has complicated topics in it, a few classes might be confusing, but overall Dr Angela explains things in a clear, concise manner, and she's always pushing people to keep going by the end of each module. Thoroughly recommend it.","This course covers complex material with some potentially confusing sections, however, Dr. Angela’s clear explanations and motivational approach make it a thoroughly recommended learning experience."
It was a really excellent course I learned a lot from it. Before taking this course I did not know anything about web development but after taking this course I can say that I am now web-developer,"This reviewer found the course exceptionally valuable, significantly expanding their knowledge of web development from a complete beginner to someone capable of developing websites."
"This being my first web development course, I felt a tremendous sense of accomplishment upon completing it, and I attribute this success to Angela Yu's exceptional teaching. While this course may not make you a fully-fledged developer, it certainly motivates you to explore further and equips you with valuable insights on how to learn, apply your knowledge, and identify areas for growth. It serves as an excellent introduction to the vast world of web development. Admittedly, the course content is somewhat outdated, necessitating the use of additional resources. Nevertheless, considering its price, this course is an absolute gem. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Angela for her mentorship and the impressive way she delivers her lessons.","This review praises Angela Yu's web development course as a motivating and insightful introduction to the field, equipping learners with valuable knowledge and learning strategies – despite some outdated content. It’s considered an excellent value for its price and a fantastic starting point for aspiring developers."
"It's definitely worth it to buy this course. Specially i was struggling one of the important topics in programming API that Angela deep dive into this field. She taught both frontend and backend topics detailed, subtitle is clear. Teaching process is fun, Angela's advertisement is valuable at the end of each section and keep motivate me. I highly recommend this course to new beginners.","This course is highly recommended, particularly for beginners, due to Angela’s thorough and engaging deep dive into programming APIs, along with clear subtitles and motivating content."
Because it's very help full for me. When I start this course I just know about the HTML and CSS but letter on I got to much from this course. And it helps me to be the one in my life. I just start but now I can do much more in my Web career. And I give four star because of one or two module are not completely update.,"This course was incredibly helpful for the reviewer, significantly expanding their knowledge of HTML and CSS and boosting their confidence and skills within their web career. Despite a couple of slightly outdated modules, the overall experience earned a four-star rating due to its positive impact."
"Awesome course! Everything is expressed an explained straight to the point. I come from learning how to code from books which gives a deeper understanding, I wish that I started out with her videos to save time. I moved from books to this course for the exercises, quizzes and projects to make sure that I utilize, practice, and retain the material.","The reviewer highly recommends this course for its clear, concise explanations and finds it incredibly effective due to the practical exercises, quizzes, and projects which solidify learning."
After completing this course I feel confident. After lots of ups and down finally I completed this course. Thanks to you for this wonderful course and I hope that you always brings new things. This was very wonderful and knowledgeable journey.,"The reviewer expresses confidence gained from completing the course after a challenging process, praising it as a wonderful and informative experience they hope continues."
"Amazing! Angela is an awesome speaker/teacher and the projects in the course are really interesting and realistic. Thank you, Angela and her team, for making my dream to become a developer possible! <3","This reviewer enthusiastically praised Angela's engaging teaching style and the practical, realistic nature of the course projects, ultimately stating that it helped them achieve their goal of becoming a developer."
"Everything is awesome, but as a mobile user I'm unable to do coding exercises, if there is anything that mobile users install and do coding exercises, please do mention it,it will help a lot.",The reviewer loves the app’s content but finds it frustrating that they can’t participate in coding exercises while using a mobile device – highlighting a key missing feature for mobile users.
great course for intermediate programmers but not for beginner i guess cause some topics of advancejava script has OOPS concept that means the person who didnt know programming language before would not understand.,"This course is well-suited for intermediate programmers familiar with JavaScript, particularly those comfortable with OOP concepts, as it assumes prior programming knowledge and delves into advanced topics."
"An impressive course! It is very well structured, concise and very useful due to the practical part that requires the student's involvement in creating applications. I recommend this course!","This course receives high praise for its clear structure, concise content, and valuable focus on hands-on application development – making it a highly recommended learning experience."
"It's definitely challenging, but I'm able to understand and continue with the modules. I can't know for sure if I'll be able to successfully become a software engineer, but if I don't, it will be on me because the Instructor is teaching good, giving many examples and exercises. So far I'm happy with this course.","The reviewer finds the course challenging yet engaging due to the instructor’s clear explanations, plentiful examples, and practice exercises. While success as a software engineer isn't guaranteed, they appreciate the quality of the instruction and are generally satisfied with the course."
"Course is great and all explanations are clear. But there are several missed concepts. The React section don't cover everything like Router, useEffect and others. Even if they covered in Web3 section I think it would be better if it will be on React section too. In my opinion after this course not everyone will start carrer on Web3. It would be better if there are more big projects like building NFT Marketplace but combining React, PostgreSQL and NodeJS together. Some courses should be updated too but it is not big problem.","This course offers clear explanations but lacks depth in key areas like React concepts and features, suggesting a focus on Web3 might be misplaced. The reviewer recommends more substantial projects incorporating multiple technologies to better prepare students for real-world career opportunities."
outdated mongodb section and overall outdate course.you can still use this as a guide by reading new documentation for the respective tech and looking at new comments can help you find solution,"This course is significantly outdated, particularly regarding MongoDB, and relies on older information that may no longer be accurate.  Readers should supplement their learning with current documentation and newer online resources to ensure they're utilizing up-to-date techniques."
"I really loved this course. Angela's teaching style is very engaging, and it feels as though she is speaking directly to you at times. She explains the concepts very well and provides challenges along the way to practice what you've just learned. I very much enjoyed this course, and I hope that she teaches courses on other development technologies soon.","This reviewer highly praised the course due to Angela’s engaging teaching style and clear explanations, coupled with helpful practice challenges. They were thoroughly satisfied and expressed a desire for her to teach more courses on related technologies."
"The only thing i didn't like was that when i was doing this course all my technology versions were way ahead of what were used in this course and this lead to many many issues and problem. Even to some point that I had to leave that section and move forward. The most problematic sections were the website deploy, the crypto and the NFT ones.","The reviewer found the course materials outdated regarding current technology versions, specifically struggling with website deployment, cryptocurrency, and NFT modules which caused significant frustration and required them to skip sections."
"Angela, you are so sweet and kind, but I was expecting a beginner friendly course. I hate the fact that we don't code along with you and I hate the fact that you expect us to solve an exercise before you showing us how to do it. It's like you expect a child to eat by himself, but he never was taught how...","The reviewer found the course lacking beginner-friendly elements, specifically criticizing the absence of coding along and the expectation to complete exercises before instruction. They felt the approach was overly demanding and lacked necessary guidance."
"It was really fun learning to be a web developer but I had a lot of problems, sometimes I didn't understand the programming logic and sometimes I felt frustrated because my program didn't work. So I really repeated a lot of explanations so it could be said that my progress was not that fast. However, I felt this was the challenge and I continued to progress and learn until I became a junior web developer in the future.","The reviewer enjoyed learning web development but struggled with understanding the logic and troubleshooting issues, leading to slower progress. Despite these challenges, they remained persistent and ultimately aimed to become a junior web developer."
"I recently completed Angela's course, and I must say it was an outstanding experience. The course was incredibly engaging and entertaining throughout. Angela's teaching style is not only informative but also very enjoyable.",This review praises Angela’s course as an outstanding and highly engaging learning experience.  The reviewer particularly highlights her enjoyable and informative teaching style.
"I enrolled in Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp 2023 with high hopes after completing the initial 32 sections, which were relatively up to date and well-structured. However, my experience took a nosedive once I reached Section 33, which focused on MongoDB.",The reviewer initially praised Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp for its strong foundation but experienced a significant decline in quality starting with the MongoDB content in Section 33.
"Angela Yu's full-stack web development course has its pros and cons. The HTML and CSS sections stand out for their clear explanations and thorough content coverage. However, the JavaScript portion, particularly the function section, falls short. Understanding how to return values can be challenging, and the examples provided may not always be helpful or relevant, leading to confusion instead of clarity.","Angela Yu's course excels in its HTML/CSS instruction but struggles with the JavaScript portion, specifically the function section where returning values is poorly explained and confusingly presented."
"The best web development online bootcamp money can get, the instructor is great and friendly, the course is engaging overall I am so happy that I took this course. Thank you, Dr. Angela Yu and Greetings from Egypt, :).","This reviewer enthusiastically recommends the web development bootcamp, praising the excellent and approachable instructor, Dr. Angela Yu, and finding the course highly engaging and beneficial."
"This is the worst course I have ever taken in my entire life. The videos are very old, there are no resources, some resources don't work anymore, and the websites it recommends no longer exist. As you watch videos, the instructor removes them randomly, and the videos are all messed up. This course is a total waste of time. There are so many better courses available for free.","This review slams the course as being incredibly poor due to outdated materials, broken resources, and an unreliable instructor who frequently removed videos. Overall, the reviewer deems it a complete waste of time and money."
"I am absolutely thrilled with this course! The course covers a wide range of web development topics, providing a comprehensive and up-to-date curriculum and Dr Angelas Yus teaching style really encourages you to push forward. Will definitely come back and review.","The reviewer is extremely satisfied with the course, praising its comprehensive content and the instructor's motivating teaching style. They plan to leave a positive review in the future."
