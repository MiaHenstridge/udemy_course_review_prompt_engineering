review,summary
HTML and CSS if very nicely covered but later sections are recorded more than 4 years back and now each and everything has updated so much that it became a pathetic experience to follow this course. This course should be updated totally or should not be named as web development bootcamp 2023?,"The customer found the initial HTML and CSS sections of the course valuable, but was extremely disappointed with the outdated content covering later topics, rendering the course experience frustrating and unsuitable for a 2023 web development bootcamp."
"Initially, I rated this course 5 stars and EVERYTHING was indeed 5 stars till authentication module where everythig was outdated and I thought it's just Authentication module and that's it BUT then React module came after where everything is so outdated that you cannot do a single thing from video without getting an error that says that way of doing it is outdated and no longer supported. I remember from Angela video that she once said that we should rethink twice before buying an outdated udemy course..Huge dissapointment at the end because I could not get a single full project from this course without not watching 8+ hours youtube tutorials to cover the holes from this course...","The customer initially praised the course but was extremely disappointed by its outdated content, particularly after the React module introduced numerous errors and required extensive external research (over 8 hours of YouTube tutorials) to complete any projects."
"Best course ever for web development. No one can match the level of her efforts that she put in making this course. After completion of this course , you will be capable for freelancing. She taught the front end and back end very well. The best thing about this course is that she keep updating the course time to time.","This customer highly recommends the web development course, praising the instructor's dedication and thoroughness in covering both front-end and back-end topics, as well as the course’s consistent updates which ultimately prepared them for freelance work."
"The course is good ! BUT I think when teaching everything together is best than separate topics , example creating projects that uses all tecnologies in one project its hard to get on beginning but good to have every thing in a same project , a project like Social Network would be great , I dont know if it exists in the next lessons , but so far has been good , Thanks","The customer found the course valuable overall, but wishes for a more integrated learning approach where projects combine multiple technologies together, suggesting a complex project like a social network would be ideal."
"just a average course, she just ask you to read other documentation for even basic concepts and because other documentation aren't for beginners, you need external sources like other youtube channels to understand. there is room for lots of improvement in the course.","The customer found the course to be average and lacking beginner-friendly explanations, relying heavily on external resources like YouTube tutorials to grasp basic concepts."
"I completed a web development bootcamp and it was an amazing experience. The instructors were knowledgeable, the curriculum was well-structured. Highly recommend it to anyone looking to get into web development.","The customer had a fantastic experience completing a web development bootcamp, praising the knowledgeable instructors and well-organized curriculum. They enthusiastically recommend it as an excellent entry point for aspiring web developers."
"This course is best for beginners who want to know the basics of web designing. It may not have some advanced topics that are not necessary for understanding basics. My only suggestion is certification is only provided for completed full courses, I requested the Author provide different types of certificates for front-end, back-end and full-stack. It will also help to attract more students, that's my humble request thankyou.","The customer found the course excellent for learning web design fundamentals but suggested offering tiered certifications (front-end, back-end, full-stack) to better cater to different skill levels and potentially attract more students."
"This course has been amazing for me to learn the fundamentals and I think it has been designed in a way for us to get stuck , read a few doc , try to figure it out and move on . Great Job !!","The customer found the course incredibly effective in teaching fundamental concepts through a challenging, hands-on learning approach that encouraged problem-solving."
Angela has been helping me to get to my educational goals. Having a outstanding teacher has helped me be successful in all of my current projects in her corse. I really love how easy she has made accessing further help on every project & I can go on my own time.,"Angela is an exceptional teacher who effectively supports students' educational goals and success, particularly appreciated for her accessible and flexible approach to providing extra help."
"This is the third course I have taken from Angela and it's as always highly interesting and project-oriented, if you want to gain leadership in the web realm just take the course and work hard. It's worth the money.","The customer found Angela’s courses to be engaging, practical, and effective for developing leadership skills in web development, recommending them as a worthwhile investment with a strong focus on hands-on projects."
"before taking this course i was a studying coding just by finding long hours YouTube videos and others. but this course was a hidden Jem for me now i found it. it is concise and to the point above all it is time saver. thank you, Angela, for making this course, wish you best of luck in your endeavors!!!","The customer was previously struggling with self-taught coding but found this course to be a valuable and efficient resource, praising its concise format and significant time-saving benefits."
Angela's course is great and is fun to follow along. I can't provide a perfect score simply because some of the more important parts on the backend segment are outdated. Though I guess some would argue that the struggle to figure out the proper solution is part of the learning process. (It was stressful nonetheless),"Angela’s course offers a fun and engaging learning experience, but it suffers from outdated information regarding the backend segment which caused frustration for the customer."
I am a manager working to refresh my knowledge and get back into hands-on development. This course has been amazing in how it is structured and how it guides me through concepts. This is what I needed and more.,"This customer found the course exceptionally well-structured and helpful in refreshing their development skills, exceeding their expectations and providing exactly what they were looking for."
"Pretty easy to understand they the teacher explains everything, even if you are a complete beginner, this is all you need to go from basic to intermediate, then, of course, you need to figure out how to become a better programmer.","The customer found the course exceptionally clear and effective for beginners, successfully transitioning them from basic to intermediate level programming skills, but noted that further self-directed learning is needed to improve overall programming abilities."
"She is an amazing teacher! Angela's teaching is outstanding. It's easy to understand, her pronunciation is clear, and even though English isn't my native language, I can follow along easily. Her valuable tips and motivational words are a great help for my learning. I highly recommend her lectures.","The customer was extremely pleased with Angela’s teaching, praising its clarity, easy understanding, and helpful tips, leading them to wholeheartedly recommend her lectures."
"For this price, it is an amazing course. It covers a wide range of programming knowledge, including GIT, CSS, JS, Node, DB, API, React, JQuery,  Web 3 and etc. The React section is a bit outdated, but the explanations are perfect! I have access to the Laracast platform, and I can make comparisons. In my opinion, Angela has created good practices and provided valuable resources for developers. It's a good starting point. However, I need new knowledge about the latest React 18 and a deeper dive into hooks, etc.","This customer found the course to be excellent value for its comprehensive coverage of various programming topics, particularly praising Angela’s teaching style and valuable resources – however, they noted that some sections, like the React content, were slightly outdated and require further updates."
"There is a big mismatch and midway updates in some of the course contents . Meanwhile you replaced the section of Mongoose DB with a new section for Postgres DB,  the subsequent sections are talking heavily about the usage of Mongoose. Not Only that but Mongoose is kept as a main part of code structure in Authentication and Security Section and left us suffering either skip this part or searching for proper solutions.","The customer expresses frustration with significant inconsistencies and changes within the course content, particularly the abrupt switch to PostgreSQL and the continued reliance on Mongoose despite its being replaced, leading to confusion and difficulties in understanding authentication and security."
"She is very good at creating the course, but at this point of time (sept 2023) i am unable to follow her videos as she just went and deleted obsolete videos and didnt warn or do anything then she post a seperate link for old video, but after deleting the videos she didt post the new video in their place, there are few new videos , but you cant understand them if havenot studied the old videos , so basically if you wish to follow this couse you need to first study old course the start new couse , so basically this new course is forcefully inserted , angela you should have posted a new course with updated video and just sell it at a lowest price","The customer expresses frustration with Angela's recent course update, criticizing the deletion of older videos without warning and creating a confusing situation where learners must first study the outdated material before understanding the new content. They believe Angela should have simply released an updated version of the course at a lower price."
"Very very well structured, and the best thing to me in this course is it's not about only learning web development from scratch and knowing the industry used jargons and best practices, but this course also teaches you to learn almost anything and many other useful stuffs. Lots of love for the instructor Dr. Angela Yu.","This customer highly praised the course for its comprehensive approach, going beyond just web development basics to teach valuable learning skills and industry knowledge, while expressing significant appreciation for the instructor, Dr. Angela Yu."
"I started this course a month ago. I found this interesting till the end of frontend module. As of now the backend modules are completely outdated. The frontend section is amazing as it's up to date. but the backend lectures are from 2018 and the technologies are changed. So, I request to check the course backend section at the time of your purchase. Again, if you want to become a frontend developer you can go for it. Please update the course as soon as possible.","The customer praised the updated frontend content but found the backend modules outdated and from 2018, requesting an update before purchasing and recommending the course for aspiring frontend developers."
"As a software professional on the embedded side that has wanting to make a jump to the web side, this is EXACTLY what I was looking for. With that being said, it starts off at a perfect pace for a beginner as well, with plenty of challenges along the way to test and refine knowledge as it's gained instead of hurrying off to the next topic.","This customer found the course perfectly suited to their transition from embedded software to web development, praising its gradual pace and challenging exercises that effectively build skills."
"I recommend to take 100 days of code using Python then proceed to this bootcamp. Python will give you better understanding because of lesser code than Javascript. and also they have some same videos for basic HTML and some code, which is really good to think without looking at the solution. you can also see the difference when using else if statement.","The customer strongly suggests starting with 100 days of Python learning due to its simpler syntax compared to JavaScript, and recommends the bootcamp after gaining a solid foundation – particularly noting the helpful videos for practicing problem-solving without immediate solutions."
"Really good course, you need to dig in on some documentation because the outdated data, but this helps to improve your skills on reading the documentation the proper way. 100% recommended.","This course is highly recommended and effectively teaches how to properly interpret and utilize technical documentation, although it relies on somewhat outdated information that requires further investigation."
"Not only is a very complete course, the way is explanined is so fun, didactic and detailed. No extra music on the background, a pleasant voice pitch and the diction of the teacher is just perfect.","This customer was extremely pleased with the course, praising its comprehensive content, engaging teaching style, and the instructor's clear and enjoyable delivery."
Angela has so much enthusiasm and it comes across in everything she says. Content is very interesting and informative - need to move on to the next lesson as soon as the last one has finished.,"Angela delivers a highly engaging and informative learning experience, with content that keeps learners motivated and eager to continue progressing."
It's a very comprehensive course in terms of the topics covered. But I think the quality of the javascript section in this course is not upto the mark. There are lots of think which are important but are not covered eg. Promise API.,"The customer found the course to be thorough overall, however, they were disappointed with the JavaScript content, particularly its lack of coverage of key concepts like the Promise API."
"The course has complicated topics in it, a few classes might be confusing, but overall Dr Angela explains things in a clear, concise manner, and she's always pushing people to keep going by the end of each module. Thoroughly recommend it.","This customer found the course content challenging at times, but praised Dr. Angela’s clear explanations and motivational approach, ultimately recommending the course highly."
It was a really excellent course I learned a lot from it. Before taking this course I did not know anything about web development but after taking this course I can say that I am now web-developer,"The customer found the course exceptionally valuable, going from having no prior knowledge of web development to feeling confident enough to call themselves a web developer."
"This being my first web development course, I felt a tremendous sense of accomplishment upon completing it, and I attribute this success to Angela Yu's exceptional teaching. While this course may not make you a fully-fledged developer, it certainly motivates you to explore further and equips you with valuable insights on how to learn, apply your knowledge, and identify areas for growth. It serves as an excellent introduction to the vast world of web development. Admittedly, the course content is somewhat outdated, necessitating the use of additional resources. Nevertheless, considering its price, this course is an absolute gem. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Angela for her mentorship and the impressive way she delivers her lessons.","This customer found Angela Yu's web development course incredibly motivating and valuable as a great introduction to the field, despite some outdated content, making it a worthwhile investment."
"It's definitely worth it to buy this course. Specially i was struggling one of the important topics in programming API that Angela deep dive into this field. She taught both frontend and backend topics detailed, subtitle is clear. Teaching process is fun, Angela's advertisement is valuable at the end of each section and keep motivate me. I highly recommend this course to new beginners.","This customer found the course exceptionally valuable, particularly due to Angela’s thorough explanation of API programming concepts and her engaging teaching style which motivated them as a beginner."
Because it's very help full for me. When I start this course I just know about the HTML and CSS but letter on I got to much from this course. And it helps me to be the one in my life. I just start but now I can do much more in my Web career. And I give four star because of one or two module are not completely update.,"This customer found the course incredibly helpful, significantly expanding their knowledge of HTML and CSS and boosting their confidence and skills within their web career – despite a couple of slightly outdated modules."
"Awesome course! Everything is expressed an explained straight to the point. I come from learning how to code from books which gives a deeper understanding, I wish that I started out with her videos to save time. I moved from books to this course for the exercises, quizzes and projects to make sure that I utilize, practice, and retain the material.","The customer highly recommends the course for its clear, concise explanations and valuable supplementary materials like exercises and projects, wishing they had started with it instead of traditional coding books."
After completing this course I feel confident. After lots of ups and down finally I completed this course. Thanks to you for this wonderful course and I hope that you always brings new things. This was very wonderful and knowledgeable journey.,"The customer expresses immense satisfaction with the course, stating they now feel confident after overcoming challenges and appreciating its valuable and engaging content."
"Amazing! Angela is an awesome speaker/teacher and the projects in the course are really interesting and realistic. Thank you, Angela and her team, for making my dream to become a developer possible! <3","The customer was thrilled with Angela's engaging teaching style and the practical, realistic nature of the course projects, ultimately helping them achieve their goal of becoming a developer."
"Everything is awesome, but as a mobile user I'm unable to do coding exercises, if there is anything that mobile users install and do coding exercises, please do mention it,it will help a lot.","The customer loved the platform’s content but expressed frustration that mobile users can’t participate in the coding exercises, suggesting guidance on necessary installations would be greatly appreciated."
great course for intermediate programmers but not for beginner i guess cause some topics of advancejava script has OOPS concept that means the person who didnt know programming language before would not understand.,"This course is excellent for intermediate JavaScript programmers, particularly those familiar with OOP concepts, but it’s likely too advanced for beginners due to its focus on advanced JavaScript topics like OOPS."
"An impressive course! It is very well structured, concise and very useful due to the practical part that requires the student's involvement in creating applications. I recommend this course!","This customer highly recommends the course, praising its well-structured format, practical application through hands-on project creation, and overall usefulness."
"It's definitely challenging, but I'm able to understand and continue with the modules. I can't know for sure if I'll be able to successfully become a software engineer, but if I don't, it will be on me because the Instructor is teaching good, giving many examples and exercises. So far I'm happy with this course.","The customer finds the course challenging yet engaging due to the instructor’s clear explanations, plentiful examples, and exercises, expressing overall satisfaction despite uncertainty about their eventual career success as a software engineer."
"Course is great and all explanations are clear. But there are several missed concepts. The React section don't cover everything like Router, useEffect and others. Even if they covered in Web3 section I think it would be better if it will be on React section too. In my opinion after this course not everyone will start carrer on Web3. It would be better if there are more big projects like building NFT Marketplace but combining React, PostgreSQL and NodeJS together. Some courses should be updated too but it is not big problem.","The customer found the course's explanations clear and valuable overall, but felt the React section lacked crucial components like Router and useEffect, suggesting a shift in focus towards Web3 was misplaced and limiting career prospects. They recommended more substantial projects incorporating multiple technologies for a truly comprehensive learning experience."
outdated mongodb section and overall outdate course.you can still use this as a guide by reading new documentation for the respective tech and looking at new comments can help you find solution,"This course is significantly outdated, relying on older MongoDB versions and lacking current information. While potentially useful as a starting point, learners should supplement it with updated documentation and newer resources to gain relevant knowledge."
"I really loved this course. Angela's teaching style is very engaging, and it feels as though she is speaking directly to you at times. She explains the concepts very well and provides challenges along the way to practice what you've just learned. I very much enjoyed this course, and I hope that she teaches courses on other development technologies soon.","The customer thoroughly enjoyed the course due to Angela’s engaging teaching style, clear explanations, and helpful practice challenges."
"The only thing i didn't like was that when i was doing this course all my technology versions were way ahead of what were used in this course and this lead to many many issues and problem. Even to some point that I had to leave that section and move forward. The most problematic sections were the website deploy, the crypto and the NFT ones.","The customer found the online course frustrating due to outdated technology versions used in the materials, causing significant technical issues particularly with the website deploy, cryptocurrency, and NFT modules that forced them to skip sections."
"Angela, you are so sweet and kind, but I was expecting a beginner friendly course. I hate the fact that we don't code along with you and I hate the fact that you expect us to solve an exercise before you showing us how to do it. It's like you expect a child to eat by himself, but he never was taught how...","Angela found the course lacking beginner-friendly elements, specifically criticizing the lack of coding along and the expectation to complete exercises independently before instruction."
"It was really fun learning to be a web developer but I had a lot of problems, sometimes I didn't understand the programming logic and sometimes I felt frustrated because my program didn't work. So I really repeated a lot of explanations so it could be said that my progress was not that fast. However, I felt this was the challenge and I continued to progress and learn until I became a junior web developer in the future.","The customer found learning web development challenging due to confusing concepts and frustrating debugging experiences, but persevered through repeated explanations and ultimately gained valuable experience on their path to becoming a junior web developer."
"I recently completed Angela's course, and I must say it was an outstanding experience. The course was incredibly engaging and entertaining throughout. Angela's teaching style is not only informative but also very enjoyable.",The customer found Angela’s course to be a highly engaging and enjoyable learning experience due to her informative and entertaining teaching style.
"I enrolled in Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp 2023 with high hopes after completing the initial 32 sections, which were relatively up to date and well-structured. However, my experience took a nosedive once I reached Section 33, which focused on MongoDB.","The customer initially praised Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp for its strong foundation but expressed significant disappointment with the later sections, specifically Section 33’s focus on MongoDB, which they found lacking."
"Angela Yu's full-stack web development course has its pros and cons. The HTML and CSS sections stand out for their clear explanations and thorough content coverage. However, the JavaScript portion, particularly the function section, falls short. Understanding how to return values can be challenging, and the examples provided may not always be helpful or relevant, leading to confusion instead of clarity.","Angela Yu's course excels in its HTML/CSS instruction but struggles with the JavaScript fundamentals, specifically the function section where returning values is poorly explained and confusing."
"The best web development online bootcamp money can get, the instructor is great and friendly, the course is engaging overall I am so happy that I took this course. Thank you, Dr. Angela Yu and Greetings from Egypt, :).","This customer highly recommends the web development bootcamp, praising the excellent and approachable instructor, Dr. Angela Yu, and finding the course to be incredibly engaging and rewarding."
"This is the worst course I have ever taken in my entire life. The videos are very old, there are no resources, some resources don't work anymore, and the websites it recommends no longer exist. As you watch videos, the instructor removes them randomly, and the videos are all messed up. This course is a total waste of time. There are so many better courses available for free.","The customer found this course to be utterly terrible due to outdated materials, broken resources, non-functional websites, and erratic video removals – ultimately deeming it a complete waste of time."
"I am absolutely thrilled with this course! The course covers a wide range of web development topics, providing a comprehensive and up-to-date curriculum and Dr Angelas Yus teaching style really encourages you to push forward. Will definitely come back and review.","The customer was extremely pleased with the course, praising its comprehensive content and the encouraging teaching style of Dr. Angela Yus."
