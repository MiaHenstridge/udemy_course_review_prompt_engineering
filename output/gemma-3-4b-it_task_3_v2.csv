review,summary
HTML and CSS if very nicely covered but later sections are recorded more than 4 years back and now each and everything has updated so much that it became a pathetic experience to follow this course. This course should be updated totally or should not be named as web development bootcamp 2023?,"The customer expresses significant frustration with the course, primarily due to outdated content (recorded over four years ago) and the rapid pace of change in web development, making it a poor learning experience."
"Initially, I rated this course 5 stars and EVERYTHING was indeed 5 stars till authentication module where everythig was outdated and I thought it's just Authentication module and that's it BUT then React module came after where everything is so outdated that you cannot do a single thing from video without getting an error that says that way of doing it is outdated and no longer supported. I remember from Angela video that she once said that we should rethink twice before buying an outdated udemy course..Huge dissapointment at the end because I could not get a single full project from this course without not watching 8+ hours youtube tutorials to cover the holes from this course...","The customer initially praised the course but experienced a significant decline in quality after the React module, finding it severely outdated and lacking support, ultimately requiring extensive external resources to complete any projects."
"Best course ever for web development. No one can match the level of her efforts that she put in making this course. After completion of this course , you will be capable for freelancing. She taught the front end and back end very well. The best thing about this course is that she keep updating the course time to time.","The customer overwhelmingly praises this web development course as exceptional, highlighting the instructor's dedication and thoroughness in teaching both front-end and back-end skills, while also appreciating the course’s consistent updates and its ability to prepare students for freelance work."
"The course is good ! BUT I think when teaching everything together is best than separate topics , example creating projects that uses all tecnologies in one project its hard to get on beginning but good to have every thing in a same project , a project like Social Network would be great , I dont know if it exists in the next lessons , but so far has been good , Thanks","The customer found the course valuable overall, but wishes for a more integrated learning experience where technologies are combined into larger, realistic projects like a social network – suggesting a desire for a more hands-on and comprehensive approach."
"just a average course, she just ask you to read other documentation for even basic concepts and because other documentation aren't for beginners, you need external sources like other youtube channels to understand. there is room for lots of improvement in the course.","The customer found the course underwhelming and lacking beginner-friendly content, relying heavily on external resources for understanding due to overly complex documentation."
"I completed a web development bootcamp and it was an amazing experience. The instructors were knowledgeable, the curriculum was well-structured. Highly recommend it to anyone looking to get into web development.","The customer had a highly positive experience with the web development bootcamp, praising the knowledgeable instructors and well-organized curriculum, and enthusiastically recommends it to others."
"This course is best for beginners who want to know the basics of web designing. It may not have some advanced topics that are not necessary for understanding basics. My only suggestion is certification is only provided for completed full courses, I requested the Author provide different types of certificates for front-end, back-end and full-stack. It will also help to attract more students, that's my humble request thankyou.",The customer found the course excellent for learning web design fundamentals but suggested improvements like offering tiered certifications to boost appeal and engagement.
"This course has been amazing for me to learn the fundamentals and I think it has been designed in a way for us to get stuck , read a few doc , try to figure it out and move on . Great Job !!","The customer is extremely pleased with the course, praising its design which effectively challenges learners through guided problem-solving and documentation reading – ultimately leading to valuable learning."
Angela has been helping me to get to my educational goals. Having a outstanding teacher has helped me be successful in all of my current projects in her corse. I really love how easy she has made accessing further help on every project & I can go on my own time.,"Angela is receiving overwhelmingly positive feedback, with the customer praising her effectiveness in supporting their educational goals and expressing delight at the ease of access to additional help and flexible scheduling."
"This is the third course I have taken from Angela and it's as always highly interesting and project-oriented, if you want to gain leadership in the web realm just take the course and work hard. It's worth the money.","The customer had a very positive experience with Angela’s courses, praising their engaging, practical nature and effectiveness in developing leadership skills within the web development field – they found it worthwhile investing in."
"before taking this course i was a studying coding just by finding long hours YouTube videos and others. but this course was a hidden Jem for me now i found it. it is concise and to the point above all it is time saver. thank you, Angela, for making this course, wish you best of luck in your endeavors!!!","Angela's course provided a highly valuable and efficient learning experience for the customer, who previously struggled with unstructured online tutorials, now finding it concise and a significant time-saver."
Angela's course is great and is fun to follow along. I can't provide a perfect score simply because some of the more important parts on the backend segment are outdated. Though I guess some would argue that the struggle to figure out the proper solution is part of the learning process. (It was stressful nonetheless),"Angela’s course is enjoyable and effective for most aspects, but customers should be aware that the backend content may be outdated and potentially frustrating due to its complexity."
I am a manager working to refresh my knowledge and get back into hands-on development. This course has been amazing in how it is structured and how it guides me through concepts. This is what I needed and more.,"The customer expresses overwhelmingly positive feedback, stating that the course perfectly aligned with their needs for a refresher in hands-on development due to its well-structured guidance."
"Pretty easy to understand they the teacher explains everything, even if you are a complete beginner, this is all you need to go from basic to intermediate, then, of course, you need to figure out how to become a better programmer.","The customer found the course exceptionally clear and effective for beginners, successfully transitioning them to an intermediate level, but acknowledged that further self-directed learning is required to truly excel as a programmer."
"She is an amazing teacher! Angela's teaching is outstanding. It's easy to understand, her pronunciation is clear, and even though English isn't my native language, I can follow along easily. Her valuable tips and motivational words are a great help for my learning. I highly recommend her lectures.","The customer had an overwhelmingly positive experience with Angela, praising her outstanding teaching style, clear pronunciation, and helpful approach that made learning English accessible and motivating."
"For this price, it is an amazing course. It covers a wide range of programming knowledge, including GIT, CSS, JS, Node, DB, API, React, JQuery,  Web 3 and etc. The React section is a bit outdated, but the explanations are perfect! I have access to the Laracast platform, and I can make comparisons. In my opinion, Angela has created good practices and provided valuable resources for developers. It's a good starting point. However, I need new knowledge about the latest React 18 and a deeper dive into hooks, etc.","The customer is highly satisfied with the course’s comprehensive coverage of foundational programming topics and Angela Yu’s teaching style, but feels it lacks up-to-date information on newer technologies like React 18 and advanced hooks."
"There is a big mismatch and midway updates in some of the course contents . Meanwhile you replaced the section of Mongoose DB with a new section for Postgres DB,  the subsequent sections are talking heavily about the usage of Mongoose. Not Only that but Mongoose is kept as a main part of code structure in Authentication and Security Section and left us suffering either skip this part or searching for proper solutions.","The customer expresses significant frustration with inconsistent course content, particularly abrupt changes like the database switch and illogical continued focus on Mongoose despite its replacement, leading to confusion and a difficult learning experience."
"She is very good at creating the course, but at this point of time (sept 2023) i am unable to follow her videos as she just went and deleted obsolete videos and didnt warn or do anything then she post a seperate link for old video, but after deleting the videos she didt post the new video in their place, there are few new videos , but you cant understand them if havenot studied the old videos , so basically if you wish to follow this couse you need to first study old course the start new couse , so basically this new course is forcefully inserted , angela you should have posted a new course with updated video and just sell it at a lowest price","The customer expresses frustration with Angela's course update process, finding it confusing and disruptive due to the deletion of old videos without warning and the requirement to first study outdated material before understanding the new content. They believe a straightforward update with a lower price would have been a better approach."
"Very very well structured, and the best thing to me in this course is it's not about only learning web development from scratch and knowing the industry used jargons and best practices, but this course also teaches you to learn almost anything and many other useful stuffs. Lots of love for the instructor Dr. Angela Yu.","The customer was extremely pleased with the course's well-structured approach, particularly its focus on teaching a methodology for learning rather than just web development itself, and praised the instructor, Dr. Angela Yu."
"I started this course a month ago. I found this interesting till the end of frontend module. As of now the backend modules are completely outdated. The frontend section is amazing as it's up to date. but the backend lectures are from 2018 and the technologies are changed. So, I request to check the course backend section at the time of your purchase. Again, if you want to become a frontend developer you can go for it. Please update the course as soon as possible.","The customer is largely positive about the frontend portion of the course, finding it well-updated and engaging, but extremely disappointed with the outdated backend modules from 2018 which are no longer relevant to current technologies."
"As a software professional on the embedded side that has wanting to make a jump to the web side, this is EXACTLY what I was looking for. With that being said, it starts off at a perfect pace for a beginner as well, with plenty of challenges along the way to test and refine knowledge as it's gained instead of hurrying off to the next topic.","The customer is extremely satisfied with this resource, finding it perfectly paced for someone transitioning from embedded systems to web development, offering a balanced mix of introductory material and challenging exercises."
"I recommend to take 100 days of code using Python then proceed to this bootcamp. Python will give you better understanding because of lesser code than Javascript. and also they have some same videos for basic HTML and some code, which is really good to think without looking at the solution. you can also see the difference when using else if statement.","The customer highly recommends starting with 100 days of Python learning due to its simpler syntax compared to JavaScript, and appreciates the bootcamp's inclusion of foundational HTML content that encourages independent problem-solving."
"Really good course, you need to dig in on some documentation because the outdated data, but this helps to improve your skills on reading the documentation the proper way. 100% recommended.","The customer found the course itself excellent and highly recommends it, particularly for improving documentation reading skills. However, they noted that outdated information required extra effort to research."
"Not only is a very complete course, the way is explanined is so fun, didactic and detailed. No extra music on the background, a pleasant voice pitch and the diction of the teacher is just perfect.","The customer had an overwhelmingly positive experience with the course, praising its comprehensive content, engaging teaching style, and the instructor's clear and enjoyable delivery."
Angela has so much enthusiasm and it comes across in everything she says. Content is very interesting and informative - need to move on to the next lesson as soon as the last one has finished.,"Angela's review expresses a highly positive experience, praising her engaging enthusiasm and the valuable, informative content of the lessons, leading to a strong desire to continue learning."
It's a very comprehensive course in terms of the topics covered. But I think the quality of the javascript section in this course is not upto the mark. There are lots of think which are important but are not covered eg. Promise API.,"The customer found the course to be thorough overall, however, they were disappointed with the JavaScript content, particularly noting a lack of key topics like the Promise API."
"The course has complicated topics in it, a few classes might be confusing, but overall Dr Angela explains things in a clear, concise manner, and she's always pushing people to keep going by the end of each module. Thoroughly recommend it.","The customer found some aspects of the course challenging due to complex topics, but was ultimately very satisfied with Dr. Angela’s clear explanations and motivational approach, leading them to wholeheartedly recommend the course."
It was a really excellent course I learned a lot from it. Before taking this course I did not know anything about web development but after taking this course I can say that I am now web-developer,"The customer had a highly positive experience, stating the course was excellent and significantly increased their knowledge, transforming them from a complete beginner into a confident web developer."
"This being my first web development course, I felt a tremendous sense of accomplishment upon completing it, and I attribute this success to Angela Yu's exceptional teaching. While this course may not make you a fully-fledged developer, it certainly motivates you to explore further and equips you with valuable insights on how to learn, apply your knowledge, and identify areas for growth. It serves as an excellent introduction to the vast world of web development. Admittedly, the course content is somewhat outdated, necessitating the use of additional resources. Nevertheless, considering its price, this course is an absolute gem. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Angela for her mentorship and the impressive way she delivers her lessons.","The customer had a highly positive experience with the web development course, praising Angela Yu's teaching and feeling a strong sense of accomplishment, while acknowledging that the content is slightly outdated but still an excellent value and introduction to the field."
"It's definitely worth it to buy this course. Specially i was struggling one of the important topics in programming API that Angela deep dive into this field. She taught both frontend and backend topics detailed, subtitle is clear. Teaching process is fun, Angela's advertisement is valuable at the end of each section and keep motivate me. I highly recommend this course to new beginners.","The customer found the course exceptionally worthwhile, particularly praising Angela’s thorough explanation of APIs and her engaging teaching style which motivated them greatly – making it a strong recommendation for beginner programmers."
Because it's very help full for me. When I start this course I just know about the HTML and CSS but letter on I got to much from this course. And it helps me to be the one in my life. I just start but now I can do much more in my Web career. And I give four star because of one or two module are not completely update.,"The customer is overwhelmingly positive about the course, praising its ability to significantly expand their knowledge and boost their web career skills after initially learning HTML and CSS. They acknowledge a minor issue with outdated modules but overall rate it highly."
"Awesome course! Everything is expressed an explained straight to the point. I come from learning how to code from books which gives a deeper understanding, I wish that I started out with her videos to save time. I moved from books to this course for the exercises, quizzes and projects to make sure that I utilize, practice, and retain the material.","The customer is highly satisfied with the course's clear and concise explanations, wishing they had taken it earlier to accelerate their learning. They appreciate the practical focus on exercises, quizzes, and projects for reinforcing knowledge."
After completing this course I feel confident. After lots of ups and down finally I completed this course. Thanks to you for this wonderful course and I hope that you always brings new things. This was very wonderful and knowledgeable journey.,"The customer expresses a highly positive experience, feeling confident thanks to the course after overcoming challenges and appreciating its valuable and engaging content."
"Amazing! Angela is an awesome speaker/teacher and the projects in the course are really interesting and realistic. Thank you, Angela and her team, for making my dream to become a developer possible! <3","The customer had a fantastic experience with Angela's course, praising her engaging teaching style and relevant project work which ultimately helped them achieve their goal of becoming a developer."
"Everything is awesome, but as a mobile user I'm unable to do coding exercises, if there is anything that mobile users install and do coding exercises, please do mention it,it will help a lot.","The customer is overwhelmingly positive about the platform’s content (“everything is awesome”), but frustrated by the lack of mobile coding exercise functionality and requests guidance for other mobile users."
great course for intermediate programmers but not for beginner i guess cause some topics of advancejava script has OOPS concept that means the person who didnt know programming language before would not understand.,"The customer found the course excellent for intermediate programmers, but it was too advanced for beginners due to its focus on complex JavaScript concepts like OOPs."
"An impressive course! It is very well structured, concise and very useful due to the practical part that requires the student's involvement in creating applications. I recommend this course!","The customer had a highly positive experience with the course, praising its clear structure, practicality through application creation, and overall usefulness."
"It's definitely challenging, but I'm able to understand and continue with the modules. I can't know for sure if I'll be able to successfully become a software engineer, but if I don't, it will be on me because the Instructor is teaching good, giving many examples and exercises. So far I'm happy with this course.","The customer finds the course challenging but appreciates the instructor’s clear teaching style, plentiful examples, and exercises, leading to a positive overall experience despite uncertainty about their future career goals."
"Course is great and all explanations are clear. But there are several missed concepts. The React section don't cover everything like Router, useEffect and others. Even if they covered in Web3 section I think it would be better if it will be on React section too. In my opinion after this course not everyone will start carrer on Web3. It would be better if there are more big projects like building NFT Marketplace but combining React, PostgreSQL and NodeJS together. Some courses should be updated too but it is not big problem.","The customer found the course’s explanations clear and valuable overall, but felt it lacked depth in key React concepts and missed opportunities for larger, more practical projects like an NFT Marketplace to better prepare students for a broader range of careers."
outdated mongodb section and overall outdate course.you can still use this as a guide by reading new documentation for the respective tech and looking at new comments can help you find solution,"The customer found the course to be outdated, specifically citing an old MongoDB section, and suggests it’s best used as a supplemental resource alongside current documentation and newer community discussions."
"I really loved this course. Angela's teaching style is very engaging, and it feels as though she is speaking directly to you at times. She explains the concepts very well and provides challenges along the way to practice what you've just learned. I very much enjoyed this course, and I hope that she teaches courses on other development technologies soon.","The customer had a highly positive experience with the course, praising Angela’s engaging teaching style and effective explanations, and hopes to see her offer more courses in the future."
"The only thing i didn't like was that when i was doing this course all my technology versions were way ahead of what were used in this course and this lead to many many issues and problem. Even to some point that I had to leave that section and move forward. The most problematic sections were the website deploy, the crypto and the NFT ones.","The customer expresses significant frustration with the course due to outdated technology versions used within the material, causing numerous technical issues and requiring them to skip key sections like website deployment, cryptocurrency, and NFTs."
"Angela, you are so sweet and kind, but I was expecting a beginner friendly course. I hate the fact that we don't code along with you and I hate the fact that you expect us to solve an exercise before you showing us how to do it. It's like you expect a child to eat by himself, but he never was taught how...","Angela appreciates the instructor’s kindness but is frustrated with the course’s lack of guidance and hands-on coding experience, feeling it wasn’t designed for beginners and relied too heavily on independent problem-solving."
"It was really fun learning to be a web developer but I had a lot of problems, sometimes I didn't understand the programming logic and sometimes I felt frustrated because my program didn't work. So I really repeated a lot of explanations so it could be said that my progress was not that fast. However, I felt this was the challenge and I continued to progress and learn until I became a junior web developer in the future.","The customer found the learning experience enjoyable overall but struggled with understanding complex programming logic and experienced frustration when their code didn't work, leading to slower progress – however, they persevered and ultimately achieved their goal of becoming a junior web developer."
"I recently completed Angela's course, and I must say it was an outstanding experience. The course was incredibly engaging and entertaining throughout. Angela's teaching style is not only informative but also very enjoyable.","The customer had a fantastic experience with Angela’s course, describing it as both highly engaging and enjoyable due to her excellent and entertaining teaching style."
"I enrolled in Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp 2023 with high hopes after completing the initial 32 sections, which were relatively up to date and well-structured. However, my experience took a nosedive once I reached Section 33, which focused on MongoDB.","The customer initially praised Angela Yu's bootcamp for its strong foundation but expressed significant disappointment with the later sections, specifically Section 33’s focus on MongoDB, which marked a decline in the overall experience."
"Angela Yu's full-stack web development course has its pros and cons. The HTML and CSS sections stand out for their clear explanations and thorough content coverage. However, the JavaScript portion, particularly the function section, falls short. Understanding how to return values can be challenging, and the examples provided may not always be helpful or relevant, leading to confusion instead of clarity.","Angela Yu's course is generally positive, with strong praise for the HTML/CSS sections but struggles significantly in the JavaScript function section due to confusing explanations and unhelpful examples."
"The best web development online bootcamp money can get, the instructor is great and friendly, the course is engaging overall I am so happy that I took this course. Thank you, Dr. Angela Yu and Greetings from Egypt, :).","This customer had an overwhelmingly positive experience with the web development bootcamp, praising the excellent instructor, engaging curriculum, and expressing immense satisfaction with their investment."
"This is the worst course I have ever taken in my entire life. The videos are very old, there are no resources, some resources don't work anymore, and the websites it recommends no longer exist. As you watch videos, the instructor removes them randomly, and the videos are all messed up. This course is a total waste of time. There are so many better courses available for free.","The customer had an overwhelmingly negative experience with this course, describing it as a complete waste of time due to outdated materials, broken resources, and a poorly maintained structure."
"I am absolutely thrilled with this course! The course covers a wide range of web development topics, providing a comprehensive and up-to-date curriculum and Dr Angelas Yus teaching style really encourages you to push forward. Will definitely come back and review.","The customer is overwhelmingly positive about the course, praising its comprehensive content, current curriculum, and the instructor's motivational teaching style. They express a strong intention to return and provide further feedback."
